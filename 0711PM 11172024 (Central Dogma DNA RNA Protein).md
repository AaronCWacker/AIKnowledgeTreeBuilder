### üîé Central Dogma DNA RNA Protein



The central dogma of molecular biology describes the flow of genetic information within a biological system. It involves the transfer of information from a gene to a protein. The central dogma is often represented as a one-way street, with DNA being transcribed into RNA, which is then translated into protein. However, there are also processes that can reverse this flow of information, such as reverse transcription, in which RNA is transcribed back into DNA.

The central dogma is a fundamental concept in molecular biology, and it helps to explain how genetic information is passed from one generation to the next, as well as how that information is used to direct the synthesis of proteins, which are the building blocks of cells and the molecules that carry out many of the functions of living organisms.

The central dogma can be summarized as follows:

1. DNA is transcribed into RNA. This process is called transcription, and it involves the synthesis of an RNA molecule using a DNA template.
2. RNA is translated into protein. This process is called translation, and it involves the synthesis of a protein molecule using an RNA template.

Transcription is the first step in the central dogma, and it is the process by which the information encoded in DNA is copied into RNA. This is accomplished by the action of an enzyme called RNA polymerase, which binds to the DNA template and uses it as a guide to synthesize an RNA molecule. The RNA molecule that is produced during transcription is called a primary transcript, and it contains all of the information that is present in the DNA template.

Translation is the second step in the central dogma, and it is the process by which the information encoded in RNA is used to synthesize a protein. This is accomplished by the action of a complex molecular machine called the ribosome, which binds to the RNA template and uses it as a guide to synthesize a protein. The ribosome reads the sequence of nucleotides in the RNA template and uses this information to assemble a chain of amino acids, which are the building blocks of proteins.

Overall, the central dogma is a fundamental concept in molecular biology that describes the flow of genetic information within a biological system. It involves the transfer of information from DNA to RNA, and then from

  Nucleolar organizer regions (NORs) are parts of the DNA that are involved in
RNA transcription. Due to the silver affinity of associated proteins,
argyrophilic NORs (AgNORs) can be visualized using silver-based staining. The
average number of AgNORs per nucleus has been shown to be a prognostic factor
for predicting the outcome of many tumors. Since manual detection of AgNORs is
laborious, automation is of high interest. We present a deep learning-based
pipeline for automatically determining the AgNOR-score from histopathological
sections. An additional annotation experiment was conducted with six
pathologists to provide an independent performance evaluation of our approach.
Across all raters and images, we found a mean squared error of 0.054 between
the AgNOR- scores of the experts and those of the model, indicating that our
approach offers performance comparable to humans.

*Bassam AlKindy, Christophe Guyeux, Jean-Fran\c{c}ois Couchot, Michel  Salomon, Jacques M. Bahi* 

  In computational biology and bioinformatics, the manner to understand
evolution processes within various related organisms paid a lot of attention
these last decades. However, accurate methodologies are still needed to
discover genes content evolution. In a previous work, two novel approaches
based on sequence similarities and genes features have been proposed. More
precisely, we proposed to use genes names, sequence similarities, or both,
insured either from NCBI or from DOGMA annotation tools. Dogma has the
advantage to be an up-to-date accurate automatic tool specifically designed for
chloroplasts, whereas NCBI possesses high quality human curated genes (together
with wrongly annotated ones). The key idea of the former proposal was to take
the best from these two tools. However, the first proposal was limited by name
variations and spelling errors on the NCBI side, leading to core trees of low
quality. In this paper, these flaws are fixed by improving the comparison of
NCBI and DOGMA results, and by relaxing constraints on gene names while adding
a stage of post-validation on gene sequences. The two stages of similarity
measures, on names and sequences, are thus proposed for sequence clustering.
This improves results that can be obtained using either NCBI or DOGMA alone.
Results obtained with this quality control test are further investigated and
compared with previously released ones, on both computational and biological
aspects, considering a set of 99 chloroplastic genomes.

*Yinxi Wang, Kimmo Kartasalo, Masi Valkonen, Christer Larsson, Pekka  Ruusuvuori, Johan Hartman, Mattias Rantalainen* 

  Molecular phenotyping is central in cancer precision medicine, but remains
costly and standard methods only provide a tumour average profile. Microscopic
morphological patterns observable in histopathology sections from tumours are
determined by the underlying molecular phenotype and associated with clinical
factors. The relationship between morphology and molecular phenotype has a
potential to be exploited for prediction of the molecular phenotype from the
morphology visible in histopathology images.
  We report the first transcriptome-wide Expression-MOrphology (EMO) analysis
in breast cancer, where gene-specific models were optimised and validated for
prediction of mRNA expression both as a tumour average and in spatially
resolved manner. Individual deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were
optimised to predict the expression of 17,695 genes from hematoxylin and eosin
(HE) stained whole slide images (WSIs). Predictions for 9,334 (52.75%) genes
were significantly associated with RNA-sequencing estimates (FDR adjusted
p-value < 0.05). 1,011 of the genes were brought forward for validation, with
876 (87%) and 908 (90%) successfully replicated in internal and external test
data, respectively. Predicted spatial intra-tumour variabilities in expression
were validated in 76 genes, out of which 59 (77.6%) had a significant
association (FDR adjusted p-value < 0.05) with spatial transcriptomics
estimates. These results suggest that the proposed methodology can be applied
to predict both tumour average gene expression and intra-tumour spatial
expression directly from morphology, thus providing a scalable approach to
characterise intra-tumour heterogeneity.

*Jingwei Liu* 

  CovID-19 genetics analysis is critical to determine virus type,virus variant
and evaluate vaccines. In this paper, SARS-Cov-2 RNA sequence analysis relative
to region or territory is investigated. A uniform framework of sequence SVM
model with various genetics length from short to long and mixed-bases is
developed by projecting SARS-Cov-2 RNA sequence to different dimensional space,
then scoring it according to the output probability of pre-trained SVM models
to explore the territory or origin information of SARS-Cov-2. Different sample
size ratio of training set and test set is also discussed in the data analysis.
Two SARS-Cov-2 RNA classification tasks are constructed based on GISAID
database, one is for mainland, Hongkong and Taiwan of China, and the other is a
6-class classification task (Africa, Asia, Europe, North American, South
American\& Central American, Ocean) of 7 continents. For 3-class classification
of China, the Top-1 accuracy rate can reach 82.45\% (train 60\%, test=40\%);
For 2-class classification of China, the Top-1 accuracy rate can reach 97.35\%
(train 80\%, test 20\%); For 6-class classification task of world, when the
ratio of training set and test set is 20\% : 80\% , the Top-1 accuracy rate can
achieve 30.30\%. And, some Top-N results are also given.

*Yixuan Wang and Shuangyin Li and Shimin DI and Lei Chen* 

  The single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology enables researchers to
study complex biological systems and diseases with high resolution. The central
challenge is synthesizing enough scRNA-seq samples; insufficient samples can
impede downstream analysis and reproducibility. While various methods have been
attempted in past research, the resulting scRNA-seq samples were often of poor
quality or limited in terms of useful specific cell subpopulations. To address
these issues, we propose a novel method called Single-Cell Latent Diffusion
(SCLD) based on the Diffusion Model. This method is capable of synthesizing
large-scale, high-quality scRNA-seq samples, including both 'holistic' or
targeted specific cellular subpopulations within a unified framework. A
pre-guidance mechanism is designed for synthesizing specific cellular
subpopulations, while a post-guidance mechanism aims to enhance the quality of
scRNA-seq samples. The SCLD can synthesize large-scale and high-quality
scRNA-seq samples for various downstream tasks. Our experimental results
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in cell classification and data
distribution distances when evaluated on two scRNA-seq benchmarks.
Additionally, visualization experiments show the SCLD's capability in
synthesizing specific cellular subpopulations.

*Sourabh Patil, Archana Mathur, Raviprasad Aduri, Snehanshu Saha* 

  RNA protein Interactions (RPIs) play an important role in biological systems.
Recently, we have enumerated the RPIs at the residue level and have elucidated
the minimum structural unit (MSU) in these interactions to be a stretch of five
residues (Nucleotides/amino acids). Pseudouridine is the most frequent
modification in RNA. The conversion of uridine to pseudouridine involves
interactions between pseudouridine synthase and RNA. The existing models to
predict the pseudouridine sites in a given RNA sequence mainly depend on
user-defined features such as mono and dinucleotide composition/propensities of
RNA sequences. Predicting pseudouridine sites is a non-linear classification
problem with limited data points. Deep Learning models are efficient
discriminators when the data set size is reasonably large and fail when there
is a paucity of data ($<1000$ samples). To mitigate this problem, we propose a
Support Vector Machine (SVM) Kernel based on utility theory from Economics, and
using data-driven parameters (i.e. MSU) as features. For this purpose, we have
used position-specific tri/quad/pentanucleotide composition/propensity
(PSPC/PSPP) besides nucleotide and dineculeotide composition as features. SVMs
are known to work well in small data regimes and kernels in SVM are designed to
classify non-linear data. The proposed model outperforms the existing
state-of-the-art models significantly (10%-15% on average).

### 24 Feb 2022 | [Memorizing without overfitting: Bias, variance, and interpolation in  over-parameterized models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.13933) | [‚¨áÔ∏è](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.13933)
*Jason W. Rocks and Pankaj Mehta* 

  The bias-variance trade-off is a central concept in supervised learning. In
classical statistics, increasing the complexity of a model (e.g., number of
parameters) reduces bias but also increases variance. Until recently, it was
commonly believed that optimal performance is achieved at intermediate model
complexities which strike a balance between bias and variance. Modern Deep
Learning methods flout this dogma, achieving state-of-the-art performance using
"over-parameterized models" where the number of fit parameters is large enough
to perfectly fit the training data. As a result, understanding bias and
variance in over-parameterized models has emerged as a fundamental problem in
machine learning. Here, we use methods from statistical physics to derive
analytic expressions for bias and variance in two minimal models of
over-parameterization (linear regression and two-layer neural networks with
nonlinear data distributions), allowing us to disentangle properties stemming
from the model architecture and random sampling of data. In both models,
increasing the number of fit parameters leads to a phase transition where the
training error goes to zero and the test error diverges as a result of the
variance (while the bias remains finite). Beyond this threshold, the test error
of the two-layer neural network decreases due to a monotonic decrease in
\emph{both} the bias and variance in contrast with the classical bias-variance
trade-off. We also show that in contrast with classical intuition,
over-parameterized models can overfit even in the absence of noise and exhibit
bias even if the student and teacher models match. We synthesize these results
to construct a holistic understanding of generalization error and the
bias-variance trade-off in over-parameterized models and relate our results to
random matrix theory.

*Xiaoyong Pan and Junchi Yan* 

  RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) play crucial roles in many biological processes,
e.g. gene regulation. Computational identification of RBP binding sites on RNAs
are urgently needed. In particular, RBPs bind to RNAs by recognizing sequence
motifs. Thus, fast locating those motifs on RNA sequences is crucial and
time-efficient for determining whether the RNAs interact with the RBPs or not.
In this study, we present an attention based convolutional neural network,
iDeepA, to predict RNA-protein binding sites from raw RNA sequences. We first
encode RNA sequences into one-hot encoding. Next, we design a deep learning
model with a convolutional neural network (CNN) and an attention mechanism,
which automatically search for important positions, e.g. binding motifs, to
learn discriminant high-level features for predicting RBP binding sites. We
evaluate iDeepA on publicly gold-standard RBP binding sites derived from
CLIP-seq data. The results demonstrate iDeepA achieves comparable performance
with other state-of-the-art methods.

*Nayoung Kim, Minsu Kim, Jinkyoo Park* 

  Antibody design plays a pivotal role in advancing therapeutics. Although deep
learning has made rapid progress in this field, existing methods make limited
use of general protein knowledge and assume a graphical model (GM) that
violates empirical findings on proteins. To address these limitations, we
present Anfinsen Goes Neural (AGN), a graphical model that uses a pre-trained
protein language model (pLM) and encodes a seminal finding on proteins called
Anfinsen's dogma. Our framework follows a two-step process of sequence
generation with pLM and structure prediction with graph neural network (GNN).
Experiments show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art results on
benchmark experiments. We also address a critical limitation of
non-autoregressive models -- namely, that they tend to generate unrealistic
sequences with overly repeating tokens. To resolve this, we introduce a
composition-based regularization term to the cross-entropy objective that
allows an efficient trade-off between high performance and low token
repetition. We demonstrate that our approach establishes a Pareto frontier over
the current state-of-the-art. Our code is available at
https://github.com/lkny123/AGN.

  The "RNA world" represents a novel frontier for the study of fundamental
biological processes and human diseases and is paving the way for the
development of new drugs tailored to the patient's biomolecular
characteristics. Although scientific data about coding and non-coding RNA
molecules are continuously produced and available from public repositories,
they are scattered across different databases and a centralized, uniform, and
semantically consistent representation of the "RNA world" is still lacking. We
propose RNA-KG, a knowledge graph encompassing biological knowledge about RNAs
gathered from more than 50 public databases, integrating functional
relationships with genes, proteins, and chemicals and ontologically grounded
biomedical concepts. To develop RNA-KG, we first identified, pre-processed, and
characterized each data source; next, we built a meta-graph that provides an
ontological description of the KG by representing all the bio-molecular
entities and medical concepts of interest in this domain, as well as the types
of interactions connecting them. Finally, we leveraged an instance-based
semantically abstracted knowledge model to specify the ontological alignment
according to which RNA-KG was generated. RNA-KG can be downloaded in different
formats and also queried by a SPARQL endpoint. A thorough topological analysis
of the resulting heterogeneous graph provides further insights into the
characteristics of the "RNA world". RNA-KG can be both directly explored and
visualized, and/or analyzed by applying computational methods to infer
bio-medical knowledge from its heterogeneous nodes and edges. The resource can
be easily updated with new experimental data, and specific views of the overall
KG can be extracted according to the bio-medical problem to be studied.

  DNA-binding proteins are a class of proteins which have a specific or general
affinity to DNA and include three important components: transcription factors;
nucleases, and histones. DNA-binding proteins also perform important roles in
many types of cellular activities. In this paper we describe machine learning
systems for the prediction of DNA- binding proteins where a Support Vector
Machine and a Cascade Correlation Neural Network are optimized and then
compared to determine the learning algorithm that achieves the best prediction
performance. The information used for classification is derived from
characteristics that include overall charge, patch size and amino acids
composition. In total 121 DNA- binding proteins and 238 non-binding proteins
are used to build and evaluate the system. For SVM using the ANOVA Kernel with
Jack-knife evaluation, an accuracy of 86.7% has been achieved with 91.1% for
sensitivity and 85.3% for specificity. For CCNN optimized over the entire
dataset with Jack knife evaluation we report an accuracy of 75.4%, while the
values of specificity and sensitivity achieved were 72.3% and 82.6%,
respectively.

*Stefan Hoermann, Philipp Henzler, Martin Bach and Klaus Dietmayer* 

  We tackle the problem of object detection and pose estimation in a shared
space downtown environment. For perception multiple laser scanners with
360{\deg} coverage were fused in a dynamic occupancy grid map (DOGMa). A
single-stage deep convolutional neural network is trained to provide object
hypotheses comprising of shape, position, orientation and an existence score
from a single input DOGMa. Furthermore, an algorithm for offline object
extraction was developed to automatically label several hours of training data.
The algorithm is based on a two-pass trajectory extraction, forward and
backward in time. Typical for engineered algorithms, the automatic label
generation suffers from misdetections, which makes hard negative mining
impractical. Therefore, we propose a loss function counteracting the high
imbalance between mostly static background and extremely rare dynamic grid
cells. Experiments indicate, that the trained network has good generalization
capabilities since it detects objects occasionally lost by the label algorithm.
Evaluation reaches an average precision (AP) of 75.9%

  Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has revolutionized biological
discovery, providing an unbiased picture of cellular heterogeneity in tissues.
While scRNA-seq has been used extensively to provide insight into both healthy
systems and diseases, it has not been used for disease prediction or
diagnostics. Graph Attention Networks (GAT) have proven to be versatile for a
wide range of tasks by learning from both original features and graph
structures. Here we present a graph attention model for predicting disease
state from single-cell data on a large dataset of Multiple Sclerosis (MS)
patients. MS is a disease of the central nervous system that can be difficult
to diagnose. We train our model on single-cell data obtained from blood and
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for a cohort of seven MS patients and six healthy
adults (HA), resulting in 66,667 individual cells. We achieve 92 % accuracy in
predicting MS, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods such as a graph
convolutional network and a random forest classifier. Further, we use the
learned graph attention model to get insight into the features (cell types and
genes) that are important for this prediction. The graph attention model also
allow us to infer a new feature space for the cells that emphasizes the
differences between the two conditions. Finally we use the attention weights to
learn a new low-dimensional embedding that can be visualized. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first effort to use graph attention, and deep
learning in general, to predict disease state from single-cell data. We
envision applying this method to single-cell data for other diseases.

  A dynamic occupancy grid map (DOGMa) allows a fast, robust, and complete
environment representation for automated vehicles. Dynamic objects in a DOGMa,
however, are commonly represented as independent cells while modeled objects
with shape and pose are favorable. The evaluation of algorithms for object
extraction or the training and validation of learning algorithms rely on
labeled ground truth data. Manually annotating objects in a DOGMa to obtain
ground truth data is a time consuming and expensive process. Additionally the
quality of labeled data depend strongly on the variation of filtered input
data. The presented work introduces an automatic labeling process, where a full
sequence is used to extract the best possible object pose and shape in terms of
temporal consistency. A two direction temporal search is executed to trace
single objects over a sequence, where the best estimate of its extent and pose
is refined in every time step. Furthermore, the presented algorithm only uses
statistical constraints of the cell clusters for the object extraction instead
of fixed heuristic parameters. Experimental results show a well-performing
automatic labeling algorithm with real sensor data even at challenging
scenarios.

*S. Deshpande, J. Shuttleworth, J. Yang, S. Taramonli and M. England* 

  Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a class of non-coding RNAs which play a
significant role in several biological processes. RNA-seq based transcriptome
sequencing has been extensively used for identification of lncRNAs. However,
accurate identification of lncRNAs in RNA-seq datasets is crucial for exploring
their characteristic functions in the genome as most coding potential
computation (CPC) tools fail to accurately identify them in transcriptomic
data. Well-known CPC tools such as CPC2, lncScore, CPAT are primarily designed
for prediction of lncRNAs based on the GENCODE, NONCODE and CANTATAdb
databases. The prediction accuracy of these tools often drops when tested on
transcriptomic datasets. This leads to higher false positive results and
inaccuracy in the function annotation process. In this study, we present a
novel tool, PLIT, for the identification of lncRNAs in plants RNA-seq datasets.
PLIT implements a feature selection method based on L1 regularization and
iterative Random Forests (iRF) classification for selection of optimal
features. Based on sequence and codon-bias features, it classifies the RNA-seq
derived FASTA sequences into coding or long non-coding transcripts. Using L1
regularization, 31 optimal features were obtained based on lncRNA and
protein-coding transcripts from 8 plant species. The performance of the tool
was evaluated on 7 plant RNA-seq datasets using 10-fold cross-validation. The
analysis exhibited superior accuracy when evaluated against currently available
state-of-the-art CPC tools.

*Yiren Jian and Chongyang Gao and Chen Zeng and Yunjie Zhao and Soroush  Vosoughi* 

  RNA, whose functionality is largely determined by its structure, plays an
important role in many biological activities. The prediction of pairwise
structural proximity between each nucleotide of an RNA sequence can
characterize the structural information of the RNA. Historically, this problem
has been tackled by machine learning models using expert-engineered features
and trained on scarce labeled datasets. Here, we find that the knowledge
learned by a protein-coevolution Transformer-based deep neural network can be
transferred to the RNA contact prediction task. As protein datasets are orders
of magnitude larger than those for RNA contact prediction, our findings and the
subsequent framework greatly reduce the data scarcity bottleneck. Experiments
confirm that RNA contact prediction through transfer learning using a publicly
available protein model is greatly improved. Our findings indicate that the
learned structural patterns of proteins can be transferred to RNAs, opening up
potential new avenues for research.

  Protein-nucleic acid interactions play a very important role in a variety of
biological activities. Accurate identification of nucleic acid-binding residues
is a critical step in understanding the interaction mechanisms. Although many
computationally based methods have been developed to predict nucleic
acid-binding residues, challenges remain. In this study, a fast and accurate
sequence-based method, called ESM-NBR, is proposed. In ESM-NBR, we first use
the large protein language model ESM2 to extract discriminative biological
properties feature representation from protein primary sequences; then, a
multi-task deep learning model composed of stacked bidirectional long
short-term memory (BiLSTM) and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) networks is
employed to explore common and private information of DNA- and RNA-binding
residues with ESM2 feature as input. Experimental results on benchmark data
sets demonstrate that the prediction performance of ESM2 feature representation
comprehensively outperforms evolutionary information-based hidden Markov model
(HMM) features. Meanwhile, the ESM-NBR obtains the MCC values for DNA-binding
residues prediction of 0.427 and 0.391 on two independent test sets, which are
18.61 and 10.45% higher than those of the second-best methods, respectively.
Moreover, by completely discarding the time-cost multiple sequence alignment
process, the prediction speed of ESM-NBR far exceeds that of existing methods
(5.52s for a protein sequence of length 500, which is about 16 times faster
than the second-fastest method). A user-friendly standalone package and the
data of ESM-NBR are freely available for academic use at:

  Tumor cells with two nuclei (binucleated cells, BiNC) or more nuclei
(multinucleated cells, MuNC) indicate an increased amount of cellular genetic
material which is thought to facilitate oncogenesis, tumor progression and
treatment resistance. In canine cutaneous mast cell tumors (ccMCT),
binucleation and multinucleation are parameters used in cytologic and
histologic grading schemes (respectively) which correlate with poor patient
outcome. For this study, we created the first open source data-set with 19,983
annotations of BiNC and 1,416 annotations of MuNC in 32 histological whole
slide images of ccMCT. Labels were created by a pathologist and an
algorithmic-aided labeling approach with expert review of each generated
candidate. A state-of-the-art deep learning-based model yielded an $F_1$ score
of 0.675 for BiNC and 0.623 for MuNC on 11 test whole slide images. In regions
of interest ($2.37 mm^2$) extracted from these test images, 6 pathologists had
an object detection performance between 0.270 - 0.526 for BiNC and 0.316 -
0.622 for MuNC, while our model archived an $F_1$ score of 0.667 for BiNC and
0.685 for MuNC. This open dataset can facilitate development of automated image
analysis for this task and may thereby help to promote standardization of this
facet of histologic tumor prognostication.

  A central problem in computational biophysics is protein structure
prediction, i.e., finding the optimal folding of a given amino acid sequence.
This problem has been studied in a classical abstract model, the HP model,
where the protein is modeled as a sequence of H (hydrophobic) and P (polar)
amino acids on a lattice. The objective is to find conformations maximizing H-H
contacts. It is known that even in this reduced setting, the problem is
intractable (NP-hard). In this work, we apply deep reinforcement learning (DRL)
to the two-dimensional HP model. We can obtain the conformations of best known
energies for benchmark HP sequences with lengths from 20 to 50. Our DRL is
based on a deep Q-network (DQN). We find that a DQN based on long short-term
memory (LSTM) architecture greatly enhances the RL learning ability and
significantly improves the search process. DRL can sample the state space
efficiently, without the need of manual heuristics. Experimentally we show that
it can find multiple distinct best-known solutions per trial. This study
demonstrates the effectiveness of deep reinforcement learning in the HP model
for protein folding.
