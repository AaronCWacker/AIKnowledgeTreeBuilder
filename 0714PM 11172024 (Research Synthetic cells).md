====================

This repository contains the code for the synthetic cells project.

The project is divided into two main parts:

1. The simulation of the synthetic cells.
2. The analysis of the simulation results.

The simulation is implemented in Python and uses the [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) library for the neural network.

The analysis is implemented in R and uses the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) package for data manipulation and visualization.


Simulation
----------

The simulation is implemented in the `simulation.py` file.

The simulation consists of a neural network that controls the behavior of the synthetic cells. The neural network takes as input the current state of the synthetic cells and outputs the actions that the synthetic cells should take.

The neural network is trained using reinforcement learning. The reinforcement learning algorithm used is [Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06347).

The synthetic cells are simulated in a 2D environment. The synthetic cells can move, eat, and reproduce. The synthetic cells have a limited energy supply, which they use to move and eat. The synthetic cells can replenish their energy supply by eating other synthetic cells or by eating food particles that are present in the environment.


Analysis
--------

The analysis is implemented in the `analysis.R` file.

The analysis consists of several steps:

1. Load the simulation results.
2. Calculate the performance metrics.
3. Visualize the performance metrics.

The performance metrics calculated are:

- The number of synthetic cells alive at each time step.
- The total energy of the synthetic cells at each time step.
- The number of synthetic cells that have reproduced at each time step.
- The number of food particles eaten by the synthetic cells at each time step.

The performance metrics are visualized using line plots.


Requirements
------------

To run the simulation, you need to install the following Python packages:

- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)
- [numpy](https://numpy.org/)
- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)

To run the analysis, you

### 10 Jul 2022 | [Developing an NLP-based Recommender System for the Ethical, Legal, and  Social Implications of Synthetic Biology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.06360) | [‚¨áÔ∏è](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.06360)

  Synthetic biology is an emerging field that involves the engineering and
re-design of organisms for purposes such as food security, health, and
environmental protection. As such, it poses numerous ethical, legal, and social
implications (ELSI) for researchers and policy makers. Various efforts to
ensure socially responsible synthetic biology are underway. Policy making is
one regulatory avenue, and other initiatives have sought to embed social
scientists and ethicists on synthetic biology projects. However, given the
nascency of synthetic biology, the number of heterogeneous domains it spans,
and the open nature of many ethical questions, it has proven challenging to
establish widespread concrete policies, and including social scientists and
ethicists on synthetic biology teams has met with mixed success.
  This text proposes a different approach, asking instead is it possible to
develop a well-performing recommender model based upon natural language
processing (NLP) to connect synthetic biologists with information on the ELSI
of their specific research? This recommender was developed as part of a larger
project building a Synthetic Biology Knowledge System (SBKS) to accelerate
discovery and exploration of the synthetic biology design space. Our approach
aims to distill for synthetic biologists relevant ethical and social scientific
information and embed it into synthetic biology research workflows.

*Christoph Reich* 

  Time-lapse fluorescence microscopy (TLFM) is an important and powerful tool
in synthetic biological research. Modeling TLFM experiments based on real data
may enable researchers to repeat certain experiments with minor effort. This
thesis is a study towards deep learning-based modeling of TLFM experiments on
the image level. The modeling of TLFM experiments, by way of the example of
trapped yeast cells, is split into two tasks. The first task is to generate
synthetic image data based on real image data. To approach this problem, a
novel generative adversarial network, for conditionalized and unconditionalized
image generation, is proposed. The second task is the simulation of brightfield
microscopy images over multiple discrete time-steps. To tackle this simulation
task an advanced future frame prediction model is introduced. The proposed
models are trained and tested on a novel dataset that is presented in this
thesis. The obtained results showed that the modeling of TLFM experiments, with
deep learning, is a proper approach, but requires future research to
effectively model real-world experiments.

*Zhitao Yang, Zhongang Cai, Haiyi Mei, Shuai Liu, Zhaoxi Chen, Weiye  Xiao, Yukun Wei, Zhongfei Qing, Chen Wei, Bo Dai, Wayne Wu, Chen Qian, Dahua  Lin, Ziwei Liu, Lei Yang* 

  Synthetic data has emerged as a promising source for 3D human research as it
offers low-cost access to large-scale human datasets. To advance the diversity
and annotation quality of human models, we introduce a new synthetic dataset,
SynBody, with three appealing features: 1) a clothed parametric human model
that can generate a diverse range of subjects; 2) the layered human
representation that naturally offers high-quality 3D annotations to support
multiple tasks; 3) a scalable system for producing realistic data to facilitate
real-world tasks. The dataset comprises 1.2M images with corresponding accurate
3D annotations, covering 10,000 human body models, 1,187 actions, and various
viewpoints. The dataset includes two subsets for human pose and shape
estimation as well as human neural rendering. Extensive experiments on SynBody
indicate that it substantially enhances both SMPL and SMPL-X estimation.
Furthermore, the incorporation of layered annotations offers a valuable
training resource for investigating the Human Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF).

*Ryan Lingo* 

  This research delves into the construction and utilization of synthetic
datasets, specifically within the telematics sphere, leveraging OpenAI's
powerful language model, ChatGPT. Synthetic datasets present an effective
solution to challenges pertaining to data privacy, scarcity, and control over
variables - characteristics that make them particularly valuable for research
pursuits. The utility of these datasets, however, largely depends on their
quality, measured through the lenses of diversity, relevance, and coherence. To
illustrate this data creation process, a hands-on case study is conducted,
focusing on the generation of a synthetic telematics dataset. The experiment
involved an iterative guidance of ChatGPT, progressively refining prompts and
culminating in the creation of a comprehensive dataset for a hypothetical urban
planning scenario in Columbus, Ohio. Upon generation, the synthetic dataset was
subjected to an evaluation, focusing on the previously identified quality
parameters and employing descriptive statistics and visualization techniques
for a thorough analysis. Despite synthetic datasets not serving as perfect
replacements for actual world data, their potential in specific use-cases, when
executed with precision, is significant. This research underscores the
potential of AI models like ChatGPT in enhancing data availability for complex
sectors like telematics, thus paving the way for a myriad of new research
opportunities.

### 12 Oct 2021 | [Exploring constraints on CycleGAN-based CBCT enhancement for adaptive  radiotherapy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.04659) | [‚¨áÔ∏è](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.04659)
*Suraj Pai* 

  Research exploring CycleGAN-based synthetic image generation has recently
accelerated in the medical community, as it is able to leverage unpaired
datasets effectively. However, clinical acceptance of these synthetic images
pose a significant challenge as they are subject to strict evaluation
protocols. A commonly established drawback of the CycleGAN, the introduction of
artifacts in generated images is unforgivable in the case of medical images. In
an attempt to alleviate this drawback, we explore different constraints of the
CycleGAN along with investigation of adaptive control of these constraints. The
benefits of imposing additional constraints on the CycleGAN, in the form of
structure retaining losses is also explored. A generalized frequency loss
inspired by arxiv:2012.12821 that preserves content in the frequency domain
between source and target is investigated and compared with existing losses
such as the MIND loss arXiv:1809.04536. CycleGAN implementations from the
ganslate framework (https://github.com/ganslate-team/ganslate) are used for
experimentation in this thesis. Synthetic images generated from our methods are
quantitatively and qualitatively investigated and outperform the baseline
CycleGAN and other approaches. Furthermore, no observable artifacts or loss in
image quality is found, which is critical for acceptance of these synthetic
images. The synthetic medical images thus generated are also evaluated using
domain-specific evaluation and using segmentation as a downstream task, in
order to clearly highlight their applicability to clinical workflows.

*Ivan Ivanov, Stoyan K. Smoukov, Ehsan Nourafkan, Katharina Landfester,  Petra Schwille* 

  The origin of life is shrouded in mystery, with few surviving clues, obscured
by evolutionary competition. Previous reviews have touched on the complementary
approaches of top-down and bottom-up synthetic biology to augment our
understanding of living systems. Here we point out the synergies between these
fields, especially between bottom-up synthetic biology and origin of life
research. We explore recent progress made in artificial cell compartmentation
in line with the crowded cell, its metabolism, as well as cycles of growth and
division, and how those efforts are starting to be combined. Though the
complexity of current life is among its most striking characteristics, none of
life's essential features require it, and they are unlikely to have emerged
thus complex from the beginning. Rather than recovering the one true origin
lost in time, current research converges towards reproducing the emergence of
minimal life, by teasing out how complexity and evolution may arise from a set
of essential components.

*Dennis B\"ahr, Dennis Eschweiler, Anuk Bhattacharyya, Daniel  Moreno-Andr\'es, Wolfram Antonin and Johannes Stegmaier* 

  Automatic analysis of spatio-temporal microscopy images is inevitable for
state-of-the-art research in the life sciences. Recent developments in deep
learning provide powerful tools for automatic analyses of such image data, but
heavily depend on the amount and quality of provided training data to perform
well. To this end, we developed a new method for realistic generation of
synthetic 2D+t microscopy image data of fluorescently labeled cellular nuclei.
The method combines spatiotemporal statistical shape models of different cell
cycle stages with a conditional GAN to generate time series of cell populations
and provides instance-level control of cell cycle stage and the fluorescence
intensity of generated cells. We show the effect of the GAN conditioning and
create a set of synthetic images that can be readily used for training and
benchmarking of cell segmentation and tracking approaches.

*Devesh Shah (1), Anirudh Suresh (2), Alemayehu Admasu (1), Devesh  Upadhyay (1), Kalyanmoy Deb (2) ((1) Ford Motor Company, (2) Michigan State  University)* 

  The evaluation of synthetic micro-structure images is an emerging problem as
machine learning and materials science research have evolved together. Typical
state of the art methods in evaluating synthetic images from generative models
have relied on the Fr\'echet Inception Distance. However, this and other
similar methods, are limited in the materials domain due to both the unique
features that characterize physically accurate micro-structures and limited
dataset sizes. In this study we evaluate a variety of methods on scanning
electron microscope (SEM) images of graphene-reinforced polyurethane foams. The
primary objective of this paper is to report our findings with regards to the
shortcomings of existing methods so as to encourage the machine learning
community to consider enhancements in metrics for assessing quality of
synthetic images in the material science domain.

*Nuno Fachada, Diogo de Andrade* 

  Synthetic data is essential for assessing clustering techniques,
complementing and extending real data, and allowing for more complete coverage
of a given problem's space. In turn, synthetic data generators have the
potential of creating vast amounts of data -- a crucial activity when
real-world data is at premium -- while providing a well-understood generation
procedure and an interpretable instrument for methodically investigating
cluster analysis algorithms. Here, we present Clugen, a modular procedure for
synthetic data generation, capable of creating multidimensional clusters
supported by line segments using arbitrary distributions. Clugen is open
source, comprehensively unit tested and documented, and is available for the
Python, R, Julia, and MATLAB/Octave ecosystems. We demonstrate that our
proposal can produce rich and varied results in various dimensions, is fit for
use in the assessment of clustering algorithms, and has the potential to be a
widely used framework in diverse clustering-related research tasks.

*Reihaneh Torkzadehmahani, Peter Kairouz, Benedict Paten* 

  Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are one of the well-known models to
generate synthetic data including images, especially for research communities
that cannot use original sensitive datasets because they are not publicly
accessible. One of the main challenges in this area is to preserve the privacy
of individuals who participate in the training of the GAN models. To address
this challenge, we introduce a Differentially Private Conditional GAN (DP-CGAN)
training framework based on a new clipping and perturbation strategy, which
improves the performance of the model while preserving privacy of the training
dataset. DP-CGAN generates both synthetic data and corresponding labels and
leverages the recently introduced Renyi differential privacy accountant to
track the spent privacy budget. The experimental results show that DP-CGAN can
generate visually and empirically promising results on the MNIST dataset with a
single-digit epsilon parameter in differential privacy.

*Ahmad Sajedi, Samir Khaki, Ehsan Amjadian, Lucy Z. Liu, Yuri A.  Lawryshyn, Konstantinos N. Plataniotis* 

  Researchers have long tried to minimize training costs in deep learning while
maintaining strong generalization across diverse datasets. Emerging research on
dataset distillation aims to reduce training costs by creating a small
synthetic set that contains the information of a larger real dataset and
ultimately achieves test accuracy equivalent to a model trained on the whole
dataset. Unfortunately, the synthetic data generated by previous methods are
not guaranteed to distribute and discriminate as well as the original training
data, and they incur significant computational costs. Despite promising
results, there still exists a significant performance gap between models
trained on condensed synthetic sets and those trained on the whole dataset. In
this paper, we address these challenges using efficient Dataset Distillation
with Attention Matching (DataDAM), achieving state-of-the-art performance while
reducing training costs. Specifically, we learn synthetic images by matching
the spatial attention maps of real and synthetic data generated by different
layers within a family of randomly initialized neural networks. Our method
outperforms the prior methods on several datasets, including CIFAR10/100,
TinyImageNet, ImageNet-1K, and subsets of ImageNet-1K across most of the
settings, and achieves improvements of up to 6.5% and 4.1% on CIFAR100 and
ImageNet-1K, respectively. We also show that our high-quality distilled images
have practical benefits for downstream applications, such as continual learning
and neural architecture search.

  Generated synthetic data in medical research can substitute privacy and
security-sensitive data with a large-scale curated dataset, reducing data
collection and annotation costs. As part of this effort, we propose UniXGen, a
unified chest X-ray and report generation model, with the following
contributions. First, we design a unified model for bidirectional chest X-ray
and report generation by adopting a vector quantization method to discretize
chest X-rays into discrete visual tokens and formulating both tasks as sequence
generation tasks. Second, we introduce several special tokens to generate chest
X-rays with specific views that can be useful when the desired views are
unavailable. Furthermore, UniXGen can flexibly take various inputs from single
to multiple views to take advantage of the additional findings available in
other X-ray views. We adopt an efficient transformer for computational and
memory efficiency to handle the long-range input sequence of multi-view chest
X-rays with high resolution and long paragraph reports. In extensive
experiments, we show that our unified model has a synergistic effect on both
generation tasks, as opposed to training only the task-specific models. We also
find that view-specific special tokens can distinguish between different views
and properly generate specific views even if they do not exist in the dataset,
and utilizing multi-view chest X-rays can faithfully capture the abnormal
findings in the additional X-rays. The source code is publicly available at:

*Yoav Alon and Xiang Yu and Huiyu Zhou* 

  Synthetic generation of three-dimensional cell models from histopathological
images aims to enhance understanding of cell mutation, and progression of
cancer, necessary for clinical assessment and optimal treatment. Classical
reconstruction algorithms based on image registration of consecutive slides of
stained tissues are prone to errors and often not suitable for the training of
three-dimensional segmentation algorithms. We propose a novel framework to
generate synthetic three-dimensional histological models based on a
generator-discriminator pattern optimizing constrained features that construct
a 3D model via a Blender interface exploiting smooth shape continuity typical
for biological specimens. To capture the spatial context of entire cell
clusters we deploy a novel deep topology transformer that implements and
attention mechanism on cell group images to extract features for the frozen
feature decoder. The proposed algorithms achieves high quantitative and
qualitative synthesis evident in comparative evaluation metrics such as a low
Frechet-Inception scores.

*Jouveer Naidoo, Nicholas Bates, Trevor Gee, Mahla Nejati* 

  This research sets out to assess the viability of using game engines to
generate synthetic training data for machine learning in the context of pallet
segmentation. Using synthetic data has been proven in prior research to be a
viable means of training neural networks and saves hours of manual labour due
to the reduced need for manual image annotation. Machine vision for pallet
detection can benefit from synthetic data as the industry increases the
development of autonomous warehousing technologies. As per our methodology, we
developed a tool capable of automatically generating large amounts of annotated
training data from 3D models at pixel-perfect accuracy and a much faster rate
than manual approaches. Regarding image segmentation, a Mask R-CNN pipeline was
used, which achieved an AP50 of 86% for individual pallets.

*Lun Ai, Shi-Shun Liang, Wang-Zhou Dai, Liam Hallett, Stephen H.  Muggleton, Geoff S. Baldwin* 

  An important application of Synthetic Biology is the engineering of the host
cell system to yield useful products. However, an increase in the scale of the
host system leads to huge design space and requires a large number of
validation trials with high experimental costs. A comprehensible machine
learning approach that efficiently explores the hypothesis space and guides
experimental design is urgently needed for the Design-Build-Test-Learn (DBTL)
cycle of the host cell system. We introduce a novel machine learning framework
ILP-iML1515 based on Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) that performs abductive
logical reasoning and actively learns from training examples. In contrast to
numerical models, ILP-iML1515 is built on comprehensible logical
representations of a genome-scale metabolic model and can update the model by
learning new logical structures from auxotrophic mutant trials. The ILP-iML1515
framework 1) allows high-throughput simulations and 2) actively selects
experiments that reduce the experimental cost of learning gene functions in
comparison to randomly selected experiments.

*Mayana Pereira, Sikha Pentyala, Anderson Nascimento, Rafael T. de  Sousa Jr., Martine De Cock* 

  Legal and ethical restrictions on accessing relevant data inhibit data
science research in critical domains such as health, finance, and education.
Synthetic data generation algorithms with privacy guarantees are emerging as a
paradigm to break this data logjam. Existing approaches, however, assume that
the data holders supply their raw data to a trusted curator, who uses it as
fuel for synthetic data generation. This severely limits the applicability, as
much of the valuable data in the world is locked up in silos, controlled by
entities who cannot show their data to each other or a central aggregator
without raising privacy concerns.
  To overcome this roadblock, we propose the first solution in which data
holders only share encrypted data for differentially private synthetic data
generation. Data holders send shares to servers who perform Secure Multiparty
Computation (MPC) computations while the original data stays encrypted.
  We instantiate this idea in an MPC protocol for the Multiplicative Weights
with Exponential Mechanism (MWEM) algorithm to generate synthetic data based on
real data originating from many data holders without reliance on a single point
of failure.

*Jiahao Xu, Yubin Ruan, Wei Bi, Guoping Huang, Shuming Shi, Lihui Chen,  Lemao Liu* 

  Back translation (BT) is one of the most significant technologies in NMT
research fields. Existing attempts on BT share a common characteristic: they
employ either beam search or random sampling to generate synthetic data with a
backward model but seldom work studies the role of synthetic data in the
performance of BT. This motivates us to ask a fundamental question: {\em what
kind of synthetic data contributes to BT performance?} Through both theoretical
and empirical studies, we identify two key factors on synthetic data
controlling the back-translation NMT performance, which are quality and
importance. Furthermore, based on our findings, we propose a simple yet
effective method to generate synthetic data to better trade off both factors so
as to yield a better performance for BT. We run extensive experiments on WMT14
DE-EN, EN-DE, and RU-EN benchmark tasks. By employing our proposed method to
generate synthetic data, our BT model significantly outperforms the standard BT
baselines (i.e., beam and sampling based methods for data generation), which
proves the effectiveness of our proposed methods.

  Creation of a synthetic dataset that faithfully represents the data
distribution and simultaneously preserves privacy is a major research
challenge. Many space partitioning based approaches have emerged in recent
years for answering statistical queries in a differentially private manner.
However, for synthetic data generation problem, recent research has been mainly
focused on deep generative models. In contrast, we exploit space partitioning
techniques together with noise perturbation and thus achieve intuitive and
transparent algorithms. We propose both data independent and data dependent
algorithms for $\epsilon$-differentially private synthetic data generation
whose kernel density resembles that of the real dataset. Additionally, we
provide theoretical results on the utility-privacy trade-offs and show how our
data dependent approach overcomes the curse of dimensionality and leads to a
scalable algorithm. We show empirical utility improvements over the prior work,
and discuss performance of our algorithm on a downstream classification task on
a real dataset.

  In the current data driven era, synthetic data, artificially generated data
that resembles the characteristics of real world data without containing actual
personal information, is gaining prominence. This is due to its potential to
safeguard privacy, increase the availability of data for research, and reduce
bias in machine learning models. This paper investigates the policies governing
the creation, utilization, and dissemination of synthetic data. Synthetic data
can be a powerful instrument for protecting the privacy of individuals, but it
also presents challenges, such as ensuring its quality and authenticity. A well
crafted synthetic data policy must strike a balance between privacy concerns
and the utility of data, ensuring that it can be utilized effectively without
compromising ethical or legal standards. Organizations and institutions must
develop standardized guidelines and best practices in order to capitalize on
the benefits of synthetic data while addressing its inherent challenges.

*Florian Bordes, Shashank Shekhar, Mark Ibrahim, Diane Bouchacourt,  Pascal Vincent, Ari S. Morcos* 

  Synthetic image datasets offer unmatched advantages for designing and
evaluating deep neural networks: they make it possible to (i) render as many
data samples as needed, (ii) precisely control each scene and yield granular
ground truth labels (and captions), (iii) precisely control distribution shifts
between training and testing to isolate variables of interest for sound
experimentation. Despite such promise, the use of synthetic image data is still
limited -- and often played down -- mainly due to their lack of realism. Most
works therefore rely on datasets of real images, which have often been scraped
from public images on the internet, and may have issues with regards to
privacy, bias, and copyright, while offering little control over how objects
precisely appear. In this work, we present a path to democratize the use of
photorealistic synthetic data: we develop a new generation of interactive
environments for representation learning research, that offer both
controllability and realism. We use the Unreal Engine, a powerful game engine
well known in the entertainment industry, to produce PUG (Photorealistic Unreal
Graphics) environments and datasets for representation learning. In this paper,
we demonstrate the potential of PUG to enable more rigorous evaluations of
vision models.
