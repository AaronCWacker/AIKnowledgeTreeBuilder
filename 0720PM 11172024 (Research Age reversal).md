### üîé Research Age reversal üî¨



Age reversal is a concept that has been explored in science fiction for decades, but it may soon become a reality. Scientists have discovered several ways to potentially reverse the aging process, and while none of them are perfect, they offer hope for those who want to live longer, healthier lives.

One way to reverse aging is through the use of stem cells. Stem cells are undifferentiated cells that can become any type of cell in the body. By injecting stem cells into older adults, scientists have been able to reverse some of the effects of aging, such as wrinkles, gray hair, and decreased energy levels.

Another way to reverse aging is through the use of telomere extension. Telomeres are the protective caps on the ends of our chromosomes, and they shorten as we age. By extending telomeres, scientists have been able to slow down the aging process and even reverse some of its effects.

A third way to reverse aging is through the use of gene therapy. By manipulating genes, scientists can increase the lifespan of animals and potentially humans. For example, scientists have been able to increase the lifespan of mice by 20% by manipulating a single gene.

While these methods show promise, they are still in the early stages of development and have not been proven to work in humans. However, researchers are optimistic that they will be able to develop effective age-reversal treatments in the future.

In addition to these scientific methods, there are also lifestyle changes that can help slow down the aging process. These include eating a healthy diet, exercising regularly, getting enough sleep, and avoiding stress. While these changes may not reverse aging, they can help improve overall health and well-being.

In conclusion, age reversal is a complex and challenging field, but scientists are making progress in developing potential treatments. Through the use of stem cells, telomere extension, and gene therapy, researchers are exploring ways to slow down or even reverse the aging process. While these methods are still in the early stages of development, they offer hope for those who want to live longer, healthier lives. In the meantime, making healthy lifestyle choices can help slow down the aging process and improve overall health and well-being.</s>

  Age progression/regression is a challenging task due to the complicated and
non-linear transformation in human aging process. Many researches have shown
that both global and local facial features are essential for face
representation, but previous GAN based methods mainly focused on the global
feature in age synthesis. To utilize both global and local facial information,
we propose a Global and Local Consistent Age Generative Adversarial Network
(GLCA-GAN). In our generator, a global network learns the whole facial
structure and simulates the aging trend of the whole face, while three crucial
facial patches are progressed or regressed by three local networks aiming at
imitating subtle changes of crucial facial subregions. To preserve most of the
details in age-attribute-irrelevant areas, our generator learns the residual
face. Moreover, we employ an identity preserving loss to better preserve the
identity information, as well as age preserving loss to enhance the accuracy of
age synthesis. A pixel loss is also adopted to preserve detailed facial
information of the input face. Our proposed method is evaluated on three face
aging datasets, i.e., CACD dataset, Morph dataset and FG-NET dataset.
Experimental results show appealing performance of the proposed method by
comparing with the state-of-the-art.

*Jiu-Cheng Xie, Jun Yang, Wenqing Wang, Feng Xu, Hao Gao* 

  Face aging has received continuous research attention over the past two
decades. Although previous works on this topic have achieved impressive
success, two longstanding problems remain unsettled: 1) generating diverse and
plausible facial aging patterns at the target age stage; 2) measuring the
rationality of identity variation between the original portrait and its
syntheses with age progression or regression. In this paper, we introduce DLAT
+ , the first algorithm that can realize Diverse and Lifespan Age
Transformation on human faces, where the diversity jointly manifests in the
transformation of facial textures and shapes. Apart from the diversity
mechanism embedded in the model, multiple consistency restrictions are
leveraged to keep it away from counterfactual aging syntheses. Moreover, we
propose a new metric to assess the rationality of Identity Deviation under Age
Gaps (IDAG) between the input face and its series of age-transformed
generations, which is based on statistical laws summarized from plenty of
genuine face-aging data. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the
uniqueness and effectiveness of our method in synthesizing diverse and
perceptually reasonable faces across the whole lifetime.

*Ari Z. Klein, Arjun Magge, Graciela Gonzalez-Hernandez* 

  Advancing the utility of social media data for research applications requires
methods for automatically detecting demographic information about social media
study populations, including users' age. The objective of this study was to
develop and evaluate a method that automatically identifies the exact age of
users based on self-reports in their tweets. Our end-to-end automatic natural
language processing (NLP) pipeline, ReportAGE, includes query patterns to
retrieve tweets that potentially mention an age, a classifier to distinguish
retrieved tweets that self-report the user's exact age ("age" tweets) and those
that do not ("no age" tweets), and rule-based extraction to identify the age.
To develop and evaluate ReportAGE, we manually annotated 11,000 tweets that
matched the query patterns. Based on 1000 tweets that were annotated by all
five annotators, inter-annotator agreement (Fleiss' kappa) was 0.80 for
distinguishing "age" and "no age" tweets, and 0.95 for identifying the exact
age among the "age" tweets on which the annotators agreed. A deep neural
network classifier, based on a RoBERTa-Large pretrained model, achieved the
highest F1-score of 0.914 (precision = 0.905, recall = 0.942) for the "age"
class. When the age extraction was evaluated using the classifier's
predictions, it achieved an F1-score of 0.855 (precision = 0.805, recall =
0.914) for the "age" class. When it was evaluated directly on the held-out test
set, it achieved an F1-score of 0.931 (precision = 0.873, recall = 0.998) for
the "age" class. We deployed ReportAGE on more than 1.2 billion tweets posted
by 245,927 users, and predicted ages for 132,637 (54%) of them. Scaling the
detection of exact age to this large number of users can advance the utility of
social media data for research applications that do not align with the
predefined age groupings of extant binary or multi-class classification
approaches.

*Si Liu, Yao Sun, Defa Zhu, Renda Bao, Wei Wang, Xiangbo Shu, Shuicheng  Yan* 

  Face aging, which renders aging faces for an input face, has attracted
extensive attention in the multimedia research. Recently, several conditional
Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs) based methods have achieved great success.
They can generate images fitting the real face distributions conditioned on
each individual age group. However, these methods fail to capture the
transition patterns, e.g., the gradual shape and texture changes between
adjacent age groups. In this paper, we propose a novel Contextual Generative
Adversarial Nets (C-GANs) to specifically take it into consideration. The
C-GANs consists of a conditional transformation network and two discriminative
networks. The conditional transformation network imitates the aging procedure
with several specially designed residual blocks. The age discriminative network
guides the synthesized face to fit the real conditional distribution. The
transition pattern discriminative network is novel, aiming to distinguish the
real transition patterns with the fake ones. It serves as an extra
regularization term for the conditional transformation network, ensuring the
generated image pairs to fit the corresponding real transition pattern
distribution. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed framework produces
appealing results by comparing with the state-of-the-art and ground truth. We
also observe performance gain for cross-age face verification.

*Hoa Nguyen and Steffen Eger* 

  Citations are a key ingredient of scientific research to relate a paper to
others published in the community. Recently, it has been noted that there is a
citation age bias in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) community, one of
the currently fastest growing AI subfields, in that the mean age of the
bibliography of NLP papers has become ever younger in the last few years,
leading to `citation amnesia' in which older knowledge is increasingly
forgotten. In this work, we put such claims into perspective by analyzing the
bibliography of $\sim$300k papers across 15 different scientific fields
submitted to the popular preprint server Arxiv in the time period from 2013 to
2022. We find that all AI subfields (in particular: cs.AI, cs.CL, cs.CV, cs.LG)
have similar trends of citation amnesia, in which the age of the bibliography
has roughly halved in the last 10 years (from above 12 in 2013 to below 7 in
2022), on average. Rather than diagnosing this as a citation age bias in the
NLP community, we believe this pattern is an artefact of the dynamics of these
research fields, in which new knowledge is produced in ever shorter time
intervals.

*Yuntao Shou, Wei Ai, Tao Meng, Keqin Li* 

  Zero-shot age estimation aims to learn feature information about age from
input images and make inferences about a given person's image or video frame
without specific sample data. The development of zero-shot age estimation can
improve the efficiency and accuracy of various applications (e.g., age
verification and secure access control, etc.), while also promoting research on
multi-modal and zero-shot learning in the social media field. For example,
zero-sample age estimation can be used to create social networks focused on
specific age groups. However, existing methods mainly focus on supervised,
labeled age estimation learning, and the prediction effect of zero-shot
learning is very poor. To tackle the above issues, we propose a novel
CLIP-driven Zero-shot Learning for Correcting Inverse Age Estimation
(CZL-CIAE). Specifically, we first introduce the CLIP model to extract image
features and text semantic information respectively, and map them into a highly
semantically aligned high-dimensional feature space. Next, we designed a new
Transformer architecture (i.e., FourierFormer) to achieve channel evolution and
spatial interaction of images, and to fuse image and text semantic information.
Finally, we introduce reversible age estimation, which uses end-to-end error
feedback to reduce the error rate of age predictions. Through extensive
experiments on multiple data sets, CZL-CIAE has achieved better age prediction
results.

*Sophie Starck, Yadunandan Vivekanand Kini, Jessica Johanna Maria  Ritter, Rickmer Braren, Daniel Rueckert and Tamara Mueller* 

  Age prediction is an important part of medical assessments and research. It
can aid in detecting diseases as well as abnormal ageing by highlighting the
discrepancy between chronological and biological age. To gain a comprehensive
understanding of age-related changes observed in various body parts, we
investigate them on a larger scale by using whole-body 3D images. We utilise
the Grad-CAM interpretability method to determine the body areas most
predictive of a person's age. We expand our analysis beyond individual subjects
by employing registration techniques to generate population-wide
interpretability maps. Our findings reveal three primary areas of interest: the
spine, the autochthonous back muscles, and the cardiac region, which exhibits
the highest importance.

*Yuval Alaluf, Or Patashnik, Daniel Cohen-Or* 

  The task of age transformation illustrates the change of an individual's
appearance over time. Accurately modeling this complex transformation over an
input facial image is extremely challenging as it requires making convincing,
possibly large changes to facial features and head shape, while still
preserving the input identity. In this work, we present an image-to-image
translation method that learns to directly encode real facial images into the
latent space of a pre-trained unconditional GAN (e.g., StyleGAN) subject to a
given aging shift. We employ a pre-trained age regression network to explicitly
guide the encoder in generating the latent codes corresponding to the desired
age. In this formulation, our method approaches the continuous aging process as
a regression task between the input age and desired target age, providing
fine-grained control over the generated image. Moreover, unlike approaches that
operate solely in the latent space using a prior on the path controlling age,
our method learns a more disentangled, non-linear path. Finally, we demonstrate
that the end-to-end nature of our approach, coupled with the rich semantic
latent space of StyleGAN, allows for further editing of the generated images.
Qualitative and quantitative evaluations show the advantages of our method
compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

### 15 Sep 2021 | [A Unified Framework for Biphasic Facial Age Translation with  Noisy-Semantic Guided Generative Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.07373) | [‚¨áÔ∏è](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.07373)
*Muyi Sun, Jian Wang, Yunfan Liu, Qi Li, Zhenan Sun* 

  Biphasic facial age translation aims at predicting the appearance of the
input face at any age. Facial age translation has received considerable
research attention in the last decade due to its practical value in cross-age
face recognition and various entertainment applications. However, most existing
methods model age changes between holistic images, regardless of the human face
structure and the age-changing patterns of individual facial components.
Consequently, the lack of semantic supervision will cause infidelity of
generated faces in detail. To this end, we propose a unified framework for
biphasic facial age translation with noisy-semantic guided generative
adversarial networks. Structurally, we project the class-aware noisy semantic
layouts to soft latent maps for the following injection operation on the
individual facial parts. In particular, we introduce two sub-networks,
ProjectionNet and ConstraintNet. ProjectionNet introduces the low-level
structural semantic information with noise map and produces soft latent maps.
ConstraintNet disentangles the high-level spatial features to constrain the
soft latent maps, which endows more age-related context into the soft latent
maps. Specifically, attention mechanism is employed in ConstraintNet for
feature disentanglement. Meanwhile, in order to mine the strongest mapping
ability of the network, we embed two types of learning strategies in the
training procedure, supervised self-driven generation and unsupervised
condition-driven cycle-consistent generation. As a result, extensive
experiments conducted on MORPH and CACD datasets demonstrate the prominent
ability of our proposed method which achieves state-of-the-art performance.

*Jian Zhao, Yu Cheng, Yi Cheng, Yang Yang, Haochong Lan, Fang Zhao, Lin  Xiong, Yan Xu, Jianshu Li, Sugiri Pranata, Shengmei Shen, Junliang Xing,  Hengzhu Liu, Shuicheng Yan, Jiashi Feng* 

  Despite the remarkable progress in face recognition related technologies,
reliably recognizing faces across ages still remains a big challenge. The
appearance of a human face changes substantially over time, resulting in
significant intra-class variations. As opposed to current techniques for
age-invariant face recognition, which either directly extract age-invariant
features for recognition, or first synthesize a face that matches target age
before feature extraction, we argue that it is more desirable to perform both
tasks jointly so that they can leverage each other. To this end, we propose a
deep Age-Invariant Model (AIM) for face recognition in the wild with three
distinct novelties. First, AIM presents a novel unified deep architecture
jointly performing cross-age face synthesis and recognition in a mutual
boosting way. Second, AIM achieves continuous face rejuvenation/aging with
remarkable photorealistic and identity-preserving properties, avoiding the
requirement of paired data and the true age of testing samples. Third, we
develop effective and novel training strategies for end-to-end learning the
whole deep architecture, which generates powerful age-invariant face
representations explicitly disentangled from the age variation. Moreover, we
propose a new large-scale Cross-Age Face Recognition (CAFR) benchmark dataset
to facilitate existing efforts and push the frontiers of age-invariant face
recognition research. Extensive experiments on both our CAFR and several other
cross-age datasets (MORPH, CACD and FG-NET) demonstrate the superiority of the
proposed AIM model over the state-of-the-arts. Benchmarking our model on one of
the most popular unconstrained face recognition datasets IJB-C additionally
verifies the promising generalizability of AIM in recognizing faces in the
wild.

*Hao Wang, Dihong Gong, Zhifeng Li and Wei Liu* 

  There has been an increasing research interest in age-invariant face
recognition. However, matching faces with big age gaps remains a challenging
problem, primarily due to the significant discrepancy of face appearances
caused by aging. To reduce such a discrepancy, in this paper we propose a novel
algorithm to remove age-related components from features mixed with both
identity and age information. Specifically, we factorize a mixed face feature
into two uncorrelated components: identity-dependent component and
age-dependent component, where the identity-dependent component includes
information that is useful for face recognition. To implement this idea, we
propose the Decorrelated Adversarial Learning (DAL) algorithm, where a
Canonical Mapping Module (CMM) is introduced to find the maximum correlation
between the paired features generated by a backbone network, while the backbone
network and the factorization module are trained to generate features reducing
the correlation. Thus, the proposed model learns the decomposed features of age
and identity whose correlation is significantly reduced. Simultaneously, the
identity-dependent feature and the age-dependent feature are respectively
supervised by ID and age preserving signals to ensure that they both contain
the correct information. Extensive experiments are conducted on popular
public-domain face aging datasets (FG-NET, MORPH Album 2, and CACD-VS) to
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

*Minghua He, Nanfei Gu, Yuntao Shi, Qionghui Zhang, Yaying Chen* 

  Artificial intelligence researchers have made significant advances in legal
intelligence in recent years. However, the existing studies have not focused on
the important value embedded in judgments reversals, which limits the
improvement of the efficiency of legal intelligence. In this paper, we propose
a causal Framework for Accurately Inferring case Reversals (FAIR), which models
the problem of judgments reversals based on real Chinese judgments. We mine the
causes of judgments reversals by causal inference methods and inject the
obtained causal relationships into the neural network as a priori knowledge.
And then, our framework is validated on a challenging dataset as a legal
judgment prediction task. The experimental results show that our framework can
tap the most critical factors in judgments reversal, and the obtained causal
relationships can effectively improve the neural network's performance. In
addition, we discuss the generalization ability of large language models for
legal intelligence tasks using ChatGPT as an example. Our experiment has found
that the generalization ability of large language models still has defects, and
mining causal relationships can effectively improve the accuracy and explain
ability of model predictions.

*Sheng He, P. Ellen Grant, Yangming Ou* 

  Deep learning can provide rapid brain age estimation based on brain magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI). However, most studies use one neural network to
extract the global information from the whole input image, ignoring the local
fine-grained details. In this paper, we propose a global-local transformer,
which consists of a global-pathway to extract the global-context information
from the whole input image and a local-pathway to extract the local
fine-grained details from local patches. The fine-grained information from the
local patches are fused with the global-context information by the attention
mechanism, inspired by the transformer, to estimate the brain age. We evaluate
the proposed method on 8 public datasets with 8,379 healthy brain MRIs with the
age range of 0-97 years. 6 datasets are used for cross-validation and 2
datasets are used for evaluating the generality. Comparing with other
state-of-the-art methods, the proposed global-local transformer reduces the
mean absolute error of the estimated ages to 2.70 years and increases the
correlation coefficient of the estimated age and the chronological age to
0.9853. In addition, our proposed method provides regional information of which
local patches are most informative for brain age estimation. Our source code is

*Yunfan Liu, Qi Li, Zhenan Sun, Tieniu Tan* 

  Face aging, which aims at aesthetically rendering a given face to predict its
future appearance, has received significant research attention in recent years.
Although great progress has been achieved with the success of Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs) in synthesizing realistic images, most existing
GAN-based face aging methods have two main problems: 1) unnatural changes of
high-level semantic information (e.g. facial attributes) due to the
insufficient utilization of prior knowledge of input faces, and 2) distortions
of low-level image content including ghosting artifacts and modifications in
age-irrelevant regions. In this paper, we introduce A3GAN, an Attribute-Aware
Attentive face aging model to address the above issues. Facial attribute
vectors are regarded as the conditional information and embedded into both the
generator and discriminator, encouraging synthesized faces to be faithful to
attributes of corresponding inputs. To improve the visual fidelity of
generation results, we leverage the attention mechanism to restrict
modifications to age-related areas and preserve image details. Moreover, the
wavelet packet transform is employed to capture textural features at multiple
scales in the frequency space. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our model in synthesizing photorealistic aged face images and
achieving state-of-the-art performance on popular face aging datasets.

  This study introduces time-reversal E(3)-equivariant neural network and
SpinGNN++ framework for constructing a comprehensive interatomic potential for
magnetic systems, encompassing spin-orbit coupling and noncollinear magnetic
moments. SpinGNN++ integrates multitask spin equivariant neural network with
explicit spin-lattice terms, including Heisenberg, Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya,
Kitaev, single-ion anisotropy, and biquadratic interactions, and employs
time-reversal equivariant neural network to learn high-order spin-lattice
interactions using time-reversal E(3)-equivariant convolutions. To validate
SpinGNN++, a complex magnetic model dataset is introduced as a benchmark and
employed to demonstrate its capabilities. SpinGNN++ provides accurate
descriptions of the complex spin-lattice coupling in monolayer CrI$_3$ and
CrTe$_2$, achieving sub-meV errors. Importantly, it facilitates large-scale
parallel spin-lattice dynamics, thereby enabling the exploration of associated
properties, including the magnetic ground state and phase transition.
Remarkably, SpinGNN++ identifies a new ferrimagnetic state as the ground
magnetic state for monolayer CrTe2, thereby enriching its phase diagram and
providing deeper insights into the distinct magnetic signals observed in
various experiments.

*Ziyuan Zhao, Peisheng Qian, Yubo Hou, Zeng Zeng* 

  Automated facial age estimation has diverse real-world applications in
multimedia analysis, e.g., video surveillance, and human-computer interaction.
However, due to the randomness and ambiguity of the aging process, age
assessment is challenging. Most research work over the topic regards the task
as one of age regression, classification, and ranking problems, and cannot well
leverage age distribution in representing labels with age ambiguity. In this
work, we propose a simple yet effective loss function for robust facial age
estimation via distribution learning, i.e., adaptive mean-residue loss, in
which, the mean loss penalizes the difference between the estimated age
distribution's mean and the ground-truth age, whereas the residue loss
penalizes the entropy of age probability out of dynamic top-K in the
distribution. Experimental results in the datasets FG-NET and CLAP2016 have
validated the effectiveness of the proposed loss. Our code is available at
https://github.com/jacobzhaoziyuan/AMR-Loss.

  The study of immune system aging, i.e. immunosenescence, is a relatively new
research topic. It deals with understanding the processes of immunodegradation
that indicate signs of functionality loss possibly leading to death. Even
though it is not possible to prevent immunosenescence, there is great benefit
in comprehending its causes, which may help to reverse some of the damage done
and thus improve life expectancy. One of the main factors influencing the
process of immunosenescence is the number and phenotypical variety of naive T
cells in an individual. This work presents a review of immunosenescence,
proposes system dynamics modelling of the processes involving the maintenance
of the naive T cell repertoire and presents some preliminary results.

*Jingye Yang, Da Wu, Kai Wang* 

  The "Reversal Curse" refers to the scenario where auto-regressive decoder
large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, trained on "A is B" fail to
learn "B is A", demonstrating a basic failure of logical deduction. This raises
a red flag in the use of GPT models for certain general tasks such as
constructing knowledge graphs, considering their adherence to this symmetric
principle. In our study, we examined a bidirectional LLM, BERT, and found that
it is immune to the reversal curse. Driven by ongoing efforts to construct
biomedical knowledge graphs with LLMs, we also embarked on evaluating more
complex but essential deductive reasoning capabilities. This process included
first training encoder and decoder language models to master the intersection
($\cap$) and union ($\cup$) operations on two sets and then moving on to assess
their capability to infer different combinations of union ($\cup$) and
intersection ($\cap$) operations on three newly created sets. The findings
showed that while both encoder and decoder language models, trained for tasks
involving two sets (union/intersection), were proficient in such scenarios,
they encountered difficulties when dealing with operations that included three
sets (various combinations of union and intersection). Our research highlights
the distinct characteristics of encoder and decoder models in simple and
complex logical reasoning. In practice, the choice between BERT and GPT should
be guided by the specific requirements and nature of the task at hand,
leveraging their respective strengths in bidirectional context comprehension
and sequence prediction.

### 07 Sep 2021 | [Deep Collaborative Multi-Modal Learning for Unsupervised Kinship  Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.02804) | [‚¨áÔ∏è](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.02804)
*Guan-Nan Dong, Chi-Man Pun, Zheng Zhang* 

  Kinship verification is a long-standing research challenge in computer
vision. The visual differences presented to the face have a significant effect
on the recognition capabilities of the kinship systems. We argue that
aggregating multiple visual knowledge can better describe the characteristics
of the subject for precise kinship identification. Typically, the age-invariant
features can represent more natural facial details. Such age-related
transformations are essential for face recognition due to the biological
effects of aging. However, the existing methods mainly focus on employing the
single-view image features for kinship identification, while more meaningful
visual properties such as race and age are directly ignored in the feature
learning step. To this end, we propose a novel deep collaborative multi-modal
learning (DCML) to integrate the underlying information presented in facial
properties in an adaptive manner to strengthen the facial details for effective
unsupervised kinship verification. Specifically, we construct a well-designed
adaptive feature fusion mechanism, which can jointly leverage the complementary
properties from different visual perspectives to produce composite features and
draw greater attention to the most informative components of spatial feature
maps. Particularly, an adaptive weighting strategy is developed based on a
novel attention mechanism, which can enhance the dependencies between different
properties by decreasing the information redundancy in channels in a
self-adaptive manner. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method,
extensive experimental evaluations conducted on four widely-used datasets show
that our DCML method is always superior to some state-of-the-art kinship

  Drawing inspiration from the philosophy of Yi Jing, Yin-Yang pair
optimization (YYPO) has been shown to achieve competitive performance in single
objective optimizations. Besides, it has the advantage of low time complexity
when comparing to other population-based optimization. As a conceptual
extension of YYPO, we proposed the novel Yi optimization (YI) algorithm as one
of the best non-population-based optimizer. Incorporating both the harmony and
reversal concept of Yi Jing, we replace the Yin-Yang pair with a Yi-point, in
which we utilize the Levy flight to update the solution and balance both the
effort of the exploration and the exploitation in the optimization process. As
a conceptual prototype, we examine YI with IEEE CEC 2017 benchmark and compare
its performance with a Levy flight-based optimizer CV1.0, the state-of-the-art
dynamical Yin-Yang pair optimization in YYPO family and a few classical
optimizers. According to the experimental results, YI shows highly competitive
performance while keeping the low time complexity. Hence, the results of this
work have implications for enhancing meta-heuristic optimizer using the
philosophy of Yi Jing, which deserves research attention.
