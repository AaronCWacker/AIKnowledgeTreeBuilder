### üîé Future Biological immortality üöÄ



Biological immortality is the concept of a person or other organism living indefinitely, barring accident or injury.

The idea of biological immortality has been a part of human culture for millennia, appearing in various forms in mythology, religion, and science fiction.

In recent years, advances in biotechnology and medicine have made the idea of biological immortality seem less far-fetched.

Scientists are now exploring various ways to extend human lifespan, including:

1. Telomere lengthening: Telomeres are the protective caps on the ends of chromosomes that shorten as we age. By lengthening telomeres, scientists believe they can slow down or even reverse the aging process.
2. Senolytic drugs: These are drugs that target and eliminate senescent cells, which are cells that are no longer able to divide and have been linked to aging and age-related diseases.
3. Gene therapy: Scientists are exploring the use of gene therapy to modify genes associated with aging and age-related diseases.
4. Stem cell therapy: Stem cells have the ability to differentiate into any type of cell in the body. By using stem cells to replace damaged or aging cells, scientists believe they can slow down or reverse the aging process.
5. Cryonics: Cryonics is the process of preserving a person's body or brain at low temperatures with the hope of reviving them in the future.

While these approaches are still in the early stages of development, they offer hope for a future where biological immortality is a reality.

Of course, there are also ethical and philosophical questions surrounding biological immortality. Some argue that it would lead to overpopulation and strain on resources, while others see it as a way to cure age-related diseases and improve quality of life.

Regardless of where one stands on the issue, it is clear that biological immortality is an area of active research and development, and one that has the potential to fundamentally change the human experience.</s>

*Ricard Sole* 

  The accelerated path of technological development, particularly at the
interface between hardware and biology has been suggested as evidence for
future major technological breakthroughs associated to our potential to
overcome biological constraints. This includes the potential of becoming
immortal, having expanded cognitive capacities thanks to hardware implants or
the creation of intelligent machines. Here I argue that several relevant
evolutionary and structural constraints might prevent achieving most (if not
all) these innovations. Instead, the coming future will bring novelties that
will challenge many other aspects of our life and that can be seen as other
feasible singularities. One particularly important one has to do with the
evolving interactions between humans and non-intelligent robots capable of
learning and communication. Here I argue that a long term interaction can lead
to a new class of "agent" (the humanbot). The way shared memories get tangled
over time will inevitably have important consequences for both sides of the
pair, whose identity as separated entities might become blurred and ultimately
vanish. Understanding such hybrid systems requires a second-order neuroscience
approach while posing serious conceptual challenges, including the definition
of consciousness.

### 05 Aug 2016 | [Self-Organising Maps in Computer Security](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.01668) | [‚¨áÔ∏è](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.01668)
*Jan Feyereisl and Uwe Aickelin* 

  Some argue that biologically inspired algorithms are the future of solving
difficult problems in computer science. Others strongly believe that the future
lies in the exploration of mathematical foundations of problems at hand. The
field of computer security tends to accept the latter view as a more
appropriate approach due to its more workable validation and verification
possibilities. The lack of rigorous scientific practices prevalent in
biologically inspired security research does not aid in presenting bio-inspired
security approaches as a viable way of dealing with complex security problems.
This chapter introduces a biologically inspired algorithm, called the Self
Organising Map (SOM), that was developed by Teuvo Kohonen in 1981. Since the
algorithm's inception it has been scrutinised by the scientific community and
analysed in more than 4000 research papers, many of which dealt with various
computer security issues, from anomaly detection, analysis of executables all
the way to wireless network monitoring. In this chapter a review of security
related SOM research undertaken in the past is presented and analysed. The
algorithm's biological analogies are detailed and the author's view on the
future possibilities of this successful bio-inspired approach are given. The
SOM algorithm's close relation to a number of vital functions of the human
brain and the emergence of multi-core computer architectures are the two main
reasons behind our assumption that the future of the SOM algorithm and its
variations is promising, notably in the field of computer security.

*Naoto Yoshida* 

  Obtaining a survival strategy (policy) is one of the fundamental problems of
biological agents. In this paper, we generalize the formulation of previous
research related to the survival of an agent and we formulate the survival
problem as a maximization of the multi-step survival probability in future time
steps. We introduce a method for converting the maximization of multi-step
survival probability into a classical reinforcement learning problem. Using
this conversion, the reward function (negative temporal cost function) is
expressed as the log of the temporal survival probability. And we show that the
objective function of the reinforcement learning in this sense is proportional
to the variational lower bound of the original problem. Finally, We empirically
demonstrate that the agent learns survival behavior by using the reward
function introduced in this paper.

  Lifelong learning - an agent's ability to learn throughout its lifetime - is
a hallmark of biological learning systems and a central challenge for
artificial intelligence (AI). The development of lifelong learning algorithms
could lead to a range of novel AI applications, but this will also require the
development of appropriate hardware accelerators, particularly if the models
are to be deployed on edge platforms, which have strict size, weight, and power
constraints. Here, we explore the design of lifelong learning AI accelerators
that are intended for deployment in untethered environments. We identify key
desirable capabilities for lifelong learning accelerators and highlight metrics
to evaluate such accelerators. We then discuss current edge AI accelerators and
explore the future design of lifelong learning accelerators, considering the
role that different emerging technologies could play.

*Elsa Lawrence, Adham El-Shazly, Srijit Seal, Chaitanya K Joshi, Pietro  Li\`o, Shantanu Singh, Andreas Bender, Pietro Sormanni, Matthew Greenig* 

  Modern life sciences research is increasingly relying on artificial
intelligence approaches to model biological systems, primarily centered around
the use of machine learning (ML) models. Although ML is undeniably useful for
identifying patterns in large, complex data sets, its widespread application in
biological sciences represents a significant deviation from traditional methods
of scientific inquiry. As such, the interplay between these models and
scientific understanding in biology is a topic with important implications for
the future of scientific research, yet it is a subject that has received little
attention. Here, we draw from an epistemological toolkit to contextualize
recent applications of ML in biological sciences under modern philosophical
theories of understanding, identifying general principles that can guide the
design and application of ML systems to model biological phenomena and advance
scientific knowledge. We propose that conceptions of scientific understanding
as information compression, qualitative intelligibility, and dependency
relation modelling provide a useful framework for interpreting ML-mediated
understanding of biological systems. Through a detailed analysis of two key
application areas of ML in modern biological research - protein structure
prediction and single cell RNA-sequencing - we explore how these features have
thus far enabled ML systems to advance scientific understanding of their target
phenomena, how they may guide the development of future ML models, and the key
obstacles that remain in preventing ML from achieving its potential as a tool
for biological discovery. Consideration of the epistemological features of ML
applications in biology will improve the prospects of these methods to solve
important problems and advance scientific understanding of living systems.

*Clement Vidal* 

  This philosophical paper explores the relation between modern scientific
simulations and the future of the universe. We argue that a simulation of an
entire universe will result from future scientific activity. This requires us
to tackle the challenge of simulating open-ended evolution at all levels in a
single simulation. The simulation should encompass not only biological
evolution, but also physical evolution (a level below) and cultural evolution
(a level above). The simulation would allow us to probe what would happen if we
would "replay the tape of the universe" with the same or different laws and
initial conditions. We also distinguish between real-world and artificial-world
modelling. Assuming that intelligent life could indeed simulate an entire
universe, this leads to two tentative hypotheses. Some authors have argued that
we may already be in a simulation run by an intelligent entity. Or, if such a
simulation could be made real, this would lead to the production of a new
universe. This last direction is argued with a careful speculative
philosophical approach, emphasizing the imperative to find a solution to the
heat death problem in cosmology. The reader is invited to consult Annex 1 for
an overview of the logical structure of this paper. -- Keywords: far future,

*Stoyan K. Smoukov* 

  It is hard to imagine with the progress in robotics that current approaches
are lacking somewhere, yet they will not be applicable to the majority of
robots in the near future. We are on the verge of two new transitions that will
transform robotics. One is already under way -- the miniaturization of robots,
to the point where invisible, microscopic robots could be around us and inside
us, performing monitoring or even life-saving functions. We have seen
systematic bio-inspired efforts to create microbe-like, microscopic robots. The
trend has parallels with miniaturization in the electronics industry, where
exponentially smaller and more energy efficient units have been produced each
generation. To put this statement in context, examples already include magnetic
microswimmer robots, employing bacterial modes of locomotion, which are
biocompatible, potentially ready for integration within our bodies. They
require lithography to create clever microscopic screw-type structures, enough
to produce the cork-screw swimming movement. Such micro-robots have
encapsulated, picked, and delivered cells, protecting them from shear forces in
fluids, while others have captured non-motile sperm, propelled them, and
ultimately fertilized an egg. We explore how such developments in micro-robots
will change our world in the relatively near future. The second trend is
bottom-up robotics, growing robots from a solution medium, as if they were
bacteria. This field is emerging at the intersection of a number of
disciplines, discussed below. An overarching common theme is the creation of
artificial life from a non-biological starting point.

*Timo C. Wunderlich, Akos F. Kungl, Eric M\"uller, Johannes Schemmel,  Mihai Petrovici* 

  Future developments in artificial intelligence will profit from the existence
of novel, non-traditional substrates for brain-inspired computing. Neuromorphic
computers aim to provide such a substrate that reproduces the brain's
capabilities in terms of adaptive, low-power information processing. We present
results from a prototype chip of the BrainScaleS-2 mixed-signal neuromorphic
system that adopts a physical-model approach with a 1000-fold acceleration of
spiking neural network dynamics relative to biological real time. Using the
embedded plasticity processor, we both simulate the Pong arcade video game and
implement a local plasticity rule that enables reinforcement learning, allowing
the on-chip neural network to learn to play the game. The experiment
demonstrates key aspects of the employed approach, such as accelerated and
flexible learning, high energy efficiency and resilience to noise.

*Amar Kumar, Anjun Hu, Brennan Nichyporuk, Jean-Pierre R. Falet,  Douglas L. Arnold, Sotirios Tsaftaris, and Tal Arbel* 

  The discovery of patient-specific imaging markers that are predictive of
future disease outcomes can help us better understand individual-level
heterogeneity of disease evolution. In fact, deep learning models that can
provide data-driven personalized markers are much more likely to be adopted in
medical practice. In this work, we demonstrate that data-driven biomarker
discovery can be achieved through a counterfactual synthesis process. We show
how a deep conditional generative model can be used to perturb local imaging
features in baseline images that are pertinent to subject-specific future
disease evolution and result in a counterfactual image that is expected to have
a different future outcome. Candidate biomarkers, therefore, result from
examining the set of features that are perturbed in this process. Through
several experiments on a large-scale, multi-scanner, multi-center multiple
sclerosis (MS) clinical trial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) dataset of
relapsing-remitting (RRMS) patients, we demonstrate that our model produces
counterfactuals with changes in imaging features that reflect established
clinical markers predictive of future MRI lesional activity at the population
level. Additional qualitative results illustrate that our model has the
potential to discover novel and subject-specific predictive markers of future
activity.

*Christoph Reich* 

  Time-lapse fluorescence microscopy (TLFM) is an important and powerful tool
in synthetic biological research. Modeling TLFM experiments based on real data
may enable researchers to repeat certain experiments with minor effort. This
thesis is a study towards deep learning-based modeling of TLFM experiments on
the image level. The modeling of TLFM experiments, by way of the example of
trapped yeast cells, is split into two tasks. The first task is to generate
synthetic image data based on real image data. To approach this problem, a
novel generative adversarial network, for conditionalized and unconditionalized
image generation, is proposed. The second task is the simulation of brightfield
microscopy images over multiple discrete time-steps. To tackle this simulation
task an advanced future frame prediction model is introduced. The proposed
models are trained and tested on a novel dataset that is presented in this
thesis. The obtained results showed that the modeling of TLFM experiments, with
deep learning, is a proper approach, but requires future research to
effectively model real-world experiments.

*Christian Reimers, David Hafezi Rachti, Guahua Liu, Alexander J.  Winkler* 

  Understanding the future climate is crucial for informed policy decisions on
climate change prevention and mitigation. Earth system models play an important
role in predicting future climate, requiring accurate representation of complex
sub-processes that span multiple time scales and spatial scales. One such
process that links seasonal and interannual climate variability to cyclical
biological events is tree phenology in deciduous broadleaf forests.
Phenological dates, such as the start and end of the growing season, are
critical for understanding the exchange of carbon and water between the
biosphere and the atmosphere. Mechanistic prediction of these dates is
challenging. Hybrid modelling, which integrates data-driven approaches into
complex models, offers a solution. In this work, as a first step towards this
goal, train a deep neural network to predict a phenological index from
meteorological time series. We find that this approach outperforms traditional
process-based models. This highlights the potential of data-driven methods to
improve climate predictions. We also analyze which variables and aspects of the
time series influence the predicted onset of the season, in order to gain a
better understanding of the advantages and limitations of our model.

*Karthik H. Shankar* 

  Encoding temporal information from the recent past as spatially distributed
activations is essential in order for the entire recent past to be
simultaneously accessible. Any biological or synthetic agent that relies on the
past to predict/plan the future, would be endowed with such a spatially
distributed temporal memory. Simplistically, we would expect that resource
limitations would demand the memory system to store only the most useful
information for future prediction. For natural signals in real world which show
scale free temporal fluctuations, the predictive information encoded in memory
is maximal if the past information is scale invariantly coarse grained. Here we
examine the general mechanism to construct a scale invariantly coarse grained
memory system. Remarkably, the generic construction is equivalent to encoding
the linear combinations of Laplace transform of the past information and their
approximated inverses. This reveals a fundamental construction constraint on
memory networks that attempt to maximize predictive information storage
relevant to the natural world.

*Zhe Dong, Deniz Oktay, Ben Poole, Alexander A. Alemi* 

  Certain biological neurons demonstrate a remarkable capability to optimally
compress the history of sensory inputs while being maximally informative about
the future. In this work, we investigate if the same can be said of artificial
neurons in recurrent neural networks (RNNs) trained with maximum likelihood.
Empirically, we find that RNNs are suboptimal in the information plane. Instead
of optimally compressing past information, they extract additional information
that is not relevant for predicting the future. We show that constraining past
information by injecting noise into the hidden state can improve RNNs in
several ways: optimality in the predictive information plane, sample quality,
heldout likelihood, and downstream classification performance.

*James Whitacre, Axel Bender* 

  A full accounting of biological robustness remains elusive; both in terms of
the mechanisms by which robustness is achieved and the forces that have caused
robustness to grow over evolutionary time. Although its importance to topics
such as ecosystem services and resilience is well recognized, the broader
relationship between robustness and evolution is only starting to be fully
appreciated. A renewed interest in this relationship has been prompted by
evidence that mutational robustness can play a positive role in the discovery
of future adaptive innovations (evolvability) and evidence of an intimate
relationship between robustness and complexity in biology.
  This paper offers a new perspective on the mechanics of evolution and the
origins of complexity, robustness, and evolvability. Here we explore the
hypothesis that degeneracy, a partial overlap in the functioning of
multi-functional components, plays a central role in the evolution and
robustness of complex forms. In support of this hypothesis, we present evidence
that degeneracy is a fundamental source of robustness, it is intimately tied to
multi-scaled complexity, and it establishes conditions that are necessary for
system evolvability.

  Biological evolution has distilled the experiences of many learners into the
general learning algorithms of humans. Our novel meta reinforcement learning
algorithm MetaGenRL is inspired by this process. MetaGenRL distills the
experiences of many complex agents to meta-learn a low-complexity neural
objective function that decides how future individuals will learn. Unlike
recent meta-RL algorithms, MetaGenRL can generalize to new environments that
are entirely different from those used for meta-training. In some cases, it
even outperforms human-engineered RL algorithms. MetaGenRL uses off-policy
second-order gradients during meta-training that greatly increase its sample
efficiency.

*Garrick Orchard and Ralph Etienne-Cummings* 

  Visual motion estimation is a computationally intensive, but important task
for sighted animals. Replicating the robustness and efficiency of biological
visual motion estimation in artificial systems would significantly enhance the
capabilities of future robotic agents. 25 years ago, in this very journal,
Carver Mead outlined his argument for replicating biological processing in
silicon circuits. His vision served as the foundation for the field of
neuromorphic engineering, which has experienced a rapid growth in interest over
recent years as the ideas and technologies mature. Replicating biological
visual sensing was one of the first tasks attempted in the neuromorphic field.
In this paper we focus specifically on the task of visual motion estimation. We
describe the task itself, present the progression of works from the early first
attempts through to the modern day state-of-the-art, and provide an outlook for
future directions in the field.

  Recent technological advancements in data acquisition tools allowed life
scientists to acquire multimodal data from different biological application
domains. Broadly categorized in three types (i.e., sequences, images, and
signals), these data are huge in amount and complex in nature. Mining such an
enormous amount of data for pattern recognition is a big challenge and requires
sophisticated data-intensive machine learning techniques. Artificial neural
network-based learning systems are well known for their pattern recognition
capabilities and lately their deep architectures - known as deep learning (DL)
- have been successfully applied to solve many complex pattern recognition
problems. Highlighting the role of DL in recognizing patterns in biological
data, this article provides - applications of DL to biological sequences,
images, and signals data; overview of open access sources of these data;
description of open source DL tools applicable on these data; and comparison of
these tools from qualitative and quantitative perspectives. At the end, it
outlines some open research challenges in mining biological data and puts

  We bound the future loss when predicting any (computably) stochastic sequence
online. Solomonoff finitely bounded the total deviation of his universal
predictor M from the true distribution m by the algorithmic complexity of m.
Here we assume we are at a time t>1 and already observed x=x_1...x_t. We bound
the future prediction performance on x_{t+1}x_{t+2}... by a new variant of
algorithmic complexity of m given x, plus the complexity of the randomness
deficiency of x. The new complexity is monotone in its condition in the sense
that this complexity can only decrease if the condition is prolonged. We also
briefly discuss potential generalizations to Bayesian model classes and to
classification problems.

  Neuromorphic computing and spiking neural networks aim to leverage biological
inspiration to achieve greater energy efficiency and computational power beyond
traditional von Neumann architectured machines. In particular, spiking neural
networks hold the potential to advance artificial intelligence as the basis of
third-generation neural networks. Aided by developments in memristive and
compute-in-memory technologies, neuromorphic computing hardware is
transitioning from laboratory prototype devices to commercial chipsets;
ushering in an era of low-power computing. As a nexus of biological, computing,
and material sciences, the literature surrounding these concepts is vast,
varied, and somewhat distinct from artificial neural network sources. This
article uses bibliometric analysis to survey the last 22 years of literature,
seeking to establish trends in publication and citation volumes (III-A);
analyze impactful authors, journals and institutions (III-B); generate an
introductory reading list (III-C); survey collaborations between countries,
institutes and authors (III-D), and to analyze changes in research topics over
the years (III-E). We analyze literature data from the Clarivate Web of Science
using standard bibliometric methods. By briefly introducing the most impactful
literature in this field from the last two decades, we encourage AI
practitioners and researchers to look beyond contemporary technologies toward a
potentially spiking future of computing.

  Deep learning has become a powerful tool in computational biology,
revolutionising the analysis and interpretation of biological data over time.
In our article review, we delve into various aspects of deep learning in
computational biology. Specifically, we examine its history, advantages, and
challenges. Our focus is on two primary applications: DNA sequence
classification and prediction, as well as protein structure prediction from
sequence data. Additionally, we provide insights into the outlook for this
field. To fully harness the potential of deep learning in computational
biology, it is crucial to address the challenges that come with it. These
challenges include the requirement for large, labelled datasets and the
interpretability of deep learning models. The use of deep learning in the
analysis of DNA sequences has brought about a significant transformation in the
detection of genomic variants and the analysis of gene expression. This has
greatly contributed to the advancement of personalised medicine and drug
discovery. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been shown to be highly
accurate in predicting genetic variations and gene expression levels. Deep
learning techniques are used for analysing epigenetic data, including DNA
methylation and histone modifications. This provides valuable insights into
metabolic conditions and gene regulation. The field of protein structure
prediction has been significantly impacted by deep learning, which has enabled
accurate determination of the three-dimensional shape of proteins and
prediction of their interactions. The future of deep learning in computational
biology looks promising. With the development of advanced deep learning models
and interpretation techniques, there is potential to overcome current
challenges and further our understanding of biological systems.
