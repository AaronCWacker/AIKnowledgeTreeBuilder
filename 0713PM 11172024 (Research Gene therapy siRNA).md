# Gene therapy siRNA

Gene therapy siRNA is a type of gene therapy that uses small interfering RNA (siRNA) to silence or inhibit the expression of specific genes. This technique has the potential to treat a wide range of diseases, including genetic disorders, cancer, and viral infections.

The process of gene therapy siRNA involves the design and synthesis of siRNA molecules that are complementary to the target gene. These siRNA molecules are then introduced into cells using various delivery methods, such as viral vectors or lipid nanoparticles. Once inside the cell, the siRNA molecules bind to the target gene and trigger its degradation, thereby preventing its expression.

One of the advantages of gene therapy siRNA is its ability to specifically target individual genes, allowing for precise regulation of gene expression. This is in contrast to traditional gene therapy approaches, which often involve the introduction of new genes into cells, which can lead to unintended consequences.

Gene therapy siRNA has shown promise in preclinical and clinical trials for a variety of diseases. For example, siRNA molecules have been used to silence genes involved in cancer, such as the KRAS gene in pancreatic cancer, and the BCL2 gene in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Additionally, siRNA molecules have been used to inhibit the replication of viruses, such as HIV and hepatitis B virus.

However, there are still challenges to be addressed in the development of gene therapy siRNA. One of the main challenges is the delivery of siRNA molecules to the target cells, as they are rapidly degraded in the bloodstream and can trigger an immune response. Additionally, off-target effects and unintended consequences of siRNA therapy need to be carefully monitored and addressed.

Despite these challenges, gene therapy siRNA holds great promise for the treatment of a wide range of diseases. With ongoing research and development, this technique may become a valuable tool in the fight against genetic disorders, cancer, and viral infections.</s>

  The pharmaceutical Research and development (R&D) process is lengthy and
costly, taking nearly a decade to bring a new drug to the market. However,
advancements in biotechnology, computational methods, and machine learning
algorithms have the potential to revolutionize drug discovery, speeding up the
process and improving patient outcomes. The COVID-19 pandemic has further
accelerated and deepened the recognition of the potential of these techniques,
especially in the areas of drug repurposing and efficacy predictions.
Meanwhile, non-small molecule therapeutic modalities such as cell therapies,
monoclonal antibodies, and RNA interference (RNAi) technology have gained
importance due to their ability to target specific disease pathways and/or
patient populations. In the field of RNAi, many experiments have been carried
out to design and select highly efficient siRNAs. However, the established
patterns for efficient siRNAs are sometimes contradictory and unable to
consistently determine the most potent siRNA molecules against a target mRNA.
Thus, this paper focuses on developing machine learning models based on the
cheminformatics representation of the nucleotide composition (i.e. AUTGC) of
siRNA to predict their potency and aid the selection of the most efficient
siRNAs for further development. The PLS (Partial Least Square) and SVR (Support
Vector Regression) machine learning models built in this work outperformed
previously published models. These models can help in predicting siRNA potency
and aid in selecting the best siRNA molecules for experimental validation and
further clinical development. The study has demonstrated the potential of
AI/machine learning models to help expedite siRNA-based drug discovery
including the discovery of potent siRNAs against SARS-CoV-2.

*Shyaman Jayasundara, Sandali Lokuge, Puwasuru Ihalagedara and  Damayanthi Herath* 

  MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous small non-coding RNAs that play an
important role in post-transcriptional gene regulation. However, the
experimental determination of miRNA sequence and structure is both expensive
and time-consuming. Therefore, computational and machine learning-based
approaches have been adopted to predict novel microRNAs. With the involvement
of data science and machine learning in biology, multiple research studies have
been conducted to find microRNAs with different computational methods and
different miRNA features. Multiple approaches are discussed in detail
considering the learning algorithm/s used, features considered, dataset/s used
and the criteria used in evaluations. This systematic review focuses on the
machine learning methods developed for miRNA identification in plants. This
will help researchers to gain a detailed idea about past studies and identify
novel paths that solve drawbacks occurred in past studies. Our findings
highlight the need for plant-specific computational methods for miRNA
identification.

*Jaya Thomas and Lee Sael* 

  MicroRNA (miRNA) are small non-coding RNAs that regulates the gene expression
at the post-transcriptional level. Determining whether a sequence segment is
miRNA is experimentally challenging. Also, experimental results are sensitive
to the experimental environment. These limitations inspire the development of
computational methods for predicting the miRNAs. We propose a deep learning
based classification model, called DP-miRNA, for predicting precursor miRNA
sequence that contains the miRNA sequence. The feature set based Restricted
Boltzmann Machine method, which we call DP-miRNA, uses 58 features that are
categorized into four groups: sequence features, folding measures, stem-loop
features and statistical feature. We evaluate the performance of the DP-miRNA
on eleven twelve data sets of varying species, including the human. The deep
neural network based classification outperformed support vector machine, neural
network, naive Baye's classifiers, k-nearest neighbors, random forests, and a
hybrid system combining support vector machine and genetic algorithm.

*Marko Petkovi\'c, Vlado Menkovski* 

  Micro RNAs (miRNA) are a type of non-coding RNA, which are involved in gene
regulation and can be associated with diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular
and neurological diseases. As such, identifying the entire genome of miRNA can
be of great relevance. Since experimental methods for novel precursor miRNA
(pre-miRNA) detection are complex and expensive, computational detection using
ML could be useful. Existing ML methods are often complex black boxes, which do
not create an interpretable structural description of pre-miRNA. In this paper,
we propose a novel framework, which makes use of generative modeling through
Variational Auto-Encoders to uncover the generative factors of pre-miRNA. After
training the VAE, the pre-miRNA description is developed using a decision tree
on the lower dimensional latent space. Applying the framework to miRNA
classification, we obtain a high reconstruction and classification performance,
while also developing an accurate miRNA description.

*Daniel H. Um, David A. Knowles, Gail E. Kaiser* 

  This paper demonstrates the utility of organized numerical representations of
genes in research involving flat string gene formats (i.e., FASTA/FASTQ5).
FASTA/FASTQ files have several current limitations, such as their large file
sizes, slow processing speeds for mapping and alignment, and contextual
dependencies. These challenges significantly hinder investigations and tasks
that involve finding similar sequences. The solution lies in transforming
sequences into an alternative representation that facilitates easier clustering
into similar groups compared to the raw sequences themselves. By assigning a
unique vector embedding to each short sequence, it is possible to more
efficiently cluster and improve upon compression performance for the string
representations of cDNA libraries. Furthermore, through learning alternative
coordinate vector embeddings based on the contexts of codon triplets, we can
demonstrate clustering based on amino acid properties. Finally, using this
sequence embedding method to encode barcodes and cDNA sequences, we can improve
the time complexity of the similarity search by coupling vector embeddings with
an algorithm that determines the proximity of vectors in Euclidean space; this
allows us to perform sequence similarity searches in a quicker and more modular
fashion.

*Muhammad Razif Rizqullah (1), Ayu Purwarianti (1) and Alham Fikri Aji  (2) ((1) Bandung Institute of Technology, (2) Mohamed bin Zayed University of  Artificial Intelligence)* 

  Nowadays, Question Answering (QA) tasks receive significant research focus,
particularly with the development of Large Language Model (LLM) such as Chat
GPT [1]. LLM can be applied to various domains, but it contradicts the
principles of information transmission when applied to the Islamic domain. In
Islam we strictly regulates the sources of information and who can give
interpretations or tafseer for that sources [2]. The approach used by LLM to
generate answers based on its own interpretation is similar to the concept of
tafseer, LLM is neither an Islamic expert nor a human which is not permitted in
Islam. Indonesia is the country with the largest Islamic believer population in
the world [3]. With the high influence of LLM, we need to make evaluation of
LLM in religious domain. Currently, there is only few religious QA dataset
available and none of them using Sirah Nabawiyah especially in Indonesian
Language. In this paper, we propose the Question Answering Sirah Nabawiyah
(QASiNa) dataset, a novel dataset compiled from Sirah Nabawiyah literatures in
Indonesian language. We demonstrate our dataset by using mBERT [4], XLM-R [5],
and IndoBERT [6] which fine-tuned with Indonesian translation of SQuAD v2.0
[7]. XLM-R model returned the best performance on QASiNa with EM of 61.20,
F1-Score of 75.94, and Substring Match of 70.00. We compare XLM-R performance
with Chat GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 [1]. Both Chat GPT version returned lower EM and
F1-Score with higher Substring Match, the gap of EM and Substring Match get
wider in GPT-4. The experiment indicate that Chat GPT tends to give excessive
interpretations as evidenced by its higher Substring Match scores compared to
EM and F1-Score, even after providing instruction and context. This concludes
Chat GPT is unsuitable for question answering task in religious domain
especially for Islamic religion.

*Byunghan Lee, Junghwan Baek, Seunghyun Park, and Sungroh Yoon* 

  MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short sequences of ribonucleic acids that control the
expression of target messenger RNAs (mRNAs) by binding them. Robust prediction
of miRNA-mRNA pairs is of utmost importance in deciphering gene regulations but
has been challenging because of high false positive rates, despite a deluge of
computational tools that normally require laborious manual feature extraction.
This paper presents an end-to-end machine learning framework for miRNA target
prediction. Leveraged by deep recurrent neural networks-based auto-encoding and
sequence-sequence interaction learning, our approach not only delivers an
unprecedented level of accuracy but also eliminates the need for manual feature
extraction. The performance gap between the proposed method and existing
alternatives is substantial (over 25% increase in F-measure), and deepTarget
delivers a quantum leap in the long-standing challenge of robust miRNA target
prediction.

### 30 Jun 2014 | [Bayesian Analysis for miRNA and mRNA Interactions Using Expression Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/1210.3456) | [‚¨áÔ∏è](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1210.3456)
*Mingjun Zhong, Rong Liu, Bo Liu* 

  MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small RNA molecules composed of 19-22 nt, which play
important regulatory roles in post-transcriptional gene regulation by
inhibiting the translation of the mRNA into proteins or otherwise cleaving the
target mRNA. Inferring miRNA targets provides useful information for
understanding the roles of miRNA in biological processes that are potentially
involved in complex diseases. Statistical methodologies for point estimation,
such as the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) algorithm,
have been proposed to identify the interactions of miRNA and mRNA based on
sequence and expression data. In this paper, we propose using the Bayesian
LASSO (BLASSO) and the non-negative Bayesian LASSO (nBLASSO) to analyse the
interactions between miRNA and mRNA using expression data. The proposed
Bayesian methods explore the posterior distributions for those parameters
required to model the miRNA-mRNA interactions. These approaches can be used to
observe the inferred effects of the miRNAs on the targets by plotting the
posterior distributions of those parameters. For comparison purposes, the Least
Squares Regression (LSR), Ridge Regression (RR), LASSO, non-negative LASSO
(nLASSO), and the proposed Bayesian approaches were applied to four public
datasets. We concluded that nLASSO and nBLASSO perform best in terms of
sensitivity and specificity. Compared to the point estimate algorithms, which
only provide single estimates for those parameters, the Bayesian methods are
more meaningful and provide credible intervals, which take into account the
uncertainty of the inferred interactions of the miRNA and mRNA. Furthermore,
Bayesian methods naturally provide statistical significance to select
convincing inferred interactions, while point estimate algorithms require a
manually chosen threshold, which is less meaningful, to choose the possible
interactions.

  We are presenting COVID-19Base, a knowledgebase highlighting the biomedical
entities related to COVID-19 disease based on literature mining. To develop
COVID-19Base, we mine the information from publicly available scientific
literature and related public resources. We considered seven topic-specific
dictionaries, including human genes, human miRNAs, human lncRNAs, diseases,
Protein Databank, drugs, and drug side effects, are integrated to mine all
scientific evidence related to COVID-19. We have employed an automated
literature mining and labeling system through a novel approach to measure the
effectiveness of drugs against diseases based on natural language processing,
sentiment analysis, and deep learning. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first knowledgebase dedicated to COVID-19, which integrates such large
variety of related biomedical entities through literature mining. Proper
investigation of the mined biomedical entities along with the identified
interactions among those, reported in COVID-19Base, would help the research
community to discover possible ways for the therapeutic treatment of COVID-19.

*Eric Nguyen, Michael Poli, Marjan Faizi, Armin Thomas, Callum  Birch-Sykes, Michael Wornow, Aman Patel, Clayton Rabideau, Stefano Massaroli,  Yoshua Bengio, Stefano Ermon, Stephen A. Baccus, Chris R\'e* 

  Genomic (DNA) sequences encode an enormous amount of information for gene
regulation and protein synthesis. Similar to natural language models,
researchers have proposed foundation models in genomics to learn generalizable
features from unlabeled genome data that can then be fine-tuned for downstream
tasks such as identifying regulatory elements. Due to the quadratic scaling of
attention, previous Transformer-based genomic models have used 512 to 4k tokens
as context (<0.001% of the human genome), significantly limiting the modeling
of long-range interactions in DNA. In addition, these methods rely on
tokenizers or fixed k-mers to aggregate meaningful DNA units, losing single
nucleotide resolution where subtle genetic variations can completely alter
protein function via single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Recently, Hyena, a
large language model based on implicit convolutions was shown to match
attention in quality while allowing longer context lengths and lower time
complexity. Leveraging Hyena's new long-range capabilities, we present
HyenaDNA, a genomic foundation model pretrained on the human reference genome
with context lengths of up to 1 million tokens at the single nucleotide-level -
an up to 500x increase over previous dense attention-based models. HyenaDNA
scales sub-quadratically in sequence length (training up to 160x faster than
Transformer), uses single nucleotide tokens, and has full global context at
each layer. We explore what longer context enables - including the first use of
in-context learning in genomics. On fine-tuned benchmarks from the Nucleotide
Transformer, HyenaDNA reaches state-of-the-art (SotA) on 12 of 18 datasets
using a model with orders of magnitude less parameters and pretraining data. On
the GenomicBenchmarks, HyenaDNA surpasses SotA on 7 of 8 datasets on average by
+10 accuracy points. Code at https://github.com/HazyResearch/hyena-dna.

*Thi Ngan Dong and Megha Khosla* 

  Growing evidence from recent studies implies that microRNA or miRNA could
serve as biomarkers in various complex human diseases. Since wet-lab
experiments are expensive and time-consuming, computational techniques for
miRNA-disease association prediction have attracted a lot of attention in
recent years. Data scarcity is one of the major challenges in building reliable
machine learning models. Data scarcity combined with the use of precalculated
hand-crafted input features has led to problems of overfitting and data
leakage.
  We overcome the limitations of existing works by proposing a novel
multi-tasking graph convolution-based approach, which we refer to as MuCoMiD.
MuCoMiD allows automatic feature extraction while incorporating knowledge from
five heterogeneous biological information sources (interactions between
miRNA/diseases and protein-coding genes (PCG), interactions between
protein-coding genes, miRNA family information, and disease ontology) in a
multi-task setting which is a novel perspective and has not been studied
before. To effectively test the generalization capability of our model, we
construct large-scale experiments on standard benchmark datasets as well as our
proposed larger independent test sets and case studies. MuCoMiD shows an
improvement of at least 3% in 5-fold CV evaluation on HMDDv2.0 and HMDDv3.0
datasets and at least 35% on larger independent test sets with unseen miRNA and
diseases over state-of-the-art approaches.

*Rania Ibrahim, Noha A. Yousri, Mohamed A. Ismail, Nagwa M. El-Makky* 

  miRNA and gene expression profiles have been proved useful for classifying
cancer samples. Efficient classifiers have been recently sought and developed.
A number of attempts to classify cancer samples using miRNA/gene expression
profiles are known in literature. However, the use of semi-supervised learning
models have been used recently in bioinformatics, to exploit the huge corpuses
of publicly available sets. Using both labeled and unlabeled sets to train
sample classifiers, have not been previously considered when gene and miRNA
expression sets are used. Moreover, there is a motivation to integrate both
miRNA and gene expression for a semi-supervised cancer classification as that
provides more information on the characteristics of cancer samples. In this
paper, two semi-supervised machine learning approaches, namely self-learning
and co-training, are adapted to enhance the quality of cancer sample
classification. These approaches exploit the huge public corpuses to enrich the
training data. In self-learning, miRNA and gene based classifiers are enhanced
independently. While in co-training, both miRNA and gene expression profiles
are used simultaneously to provide different views of cancer samples. To our
knowledge, it is the first attempt to apply these learning approaches to cancer
classification. The approaches were evaluated using breast cancer,
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and lung cancer expression sets. Results show up
to 20% improvement in F1-measure over Random Forests and SVM classifiers.
Co-Training also outperforms Low Density Separation (LDS) approach by around
25% improvement in F1-measure in breast cancer.

  With the advent of Information technology, the Bioinformatics research field
is becoming increasingly attractive to researchers and academicians. The recent
development of various Bioinformatics toolkits has facilitated the rapid
processing and analysis of vast quantities of biological data for human
perception. Most studies focus on locating two connected diseases and making
some observations to construct diverse gene regulatory interaction networks, a
forerunner to general drug design for curing illness. For instance,
Hypopharyngeal cancer is a disease that is associated with EGFR-mutated lung
adenocarcinoma. In this study, we select EGFR-mutated lung adenocarcinoma and
Hypopharyngeal cancer by finding the Lung metastases in hypopharyngeal cancer.
To conduct this study, we collect Mircorarray datasets from GEO (Gene
Expression Omnibus), an online database controlled by NCBI. Differentially
expressed genes, common genes, and hub genes between the selected two diseases
are detected for the succeeding move. Our research findings have suggested
common therapeutic molecules for the selected diseases based on 10 hub genes
with the highest interactions according to the degree topology method and the
maximum clique centrality (MCC). Our suggested therapeutic molecules will be
fruitful for patients with those two diseases simultaneously.

*Camila Riccio, Jorge Finke, Camilo Rocha* 

  This paper proposes a workflow to identify genes that respond to specific
treatments in plants. The workflow takes as input the RNA sequencing read
counts and phenotypical data of different genotypes, measured under control and
treatment conditions. It outputs a reduced group of genes marked as relevant
for treatment response. Technically, the proposed approach is both a
generalization and an extension of WGCNA. It aims to identify specific modules
of overlapping communities underlying the co-expression network of genes.
Module detection is achieved by using Hierarchical Link Clustering. The
overlapping nature of the systems' regulatory domains that generate
co-expression can be identified by such modules. LASSO regression is employed
to analyze phenotypic responses of modules to treatment.
  Results. The workflow is applied to rice (Oryza sativa), a major food source
known to be highly sensitive to salt stress. The workflow identifies 19 rice
genes that seem relevant in the response to salt stress. They are distributed
across 6 modules: 3 modules, each grouping together 3 genes, are associated to
shoot K content; 2 modules of 3 genes are associated to shoot biomass; and 1
module of 4 genes is associated to root biomass. These genes represent target
genes for the improvement of salinity tolerance in rice.
  Conclusion. A more effective framework to reduce the search-space for target
genes that respond to a specific treatment is introduced. It facilitates
experimental validation by restraining efforts to a smaller subset of genes of
high potential relevance.

  Gene selection plays a pivotal role in oncology research for improving
outcome prediction accuracy and facilitating cost-effective genomic profiling
for cancer patients. This paper introduces two gene selection strategies for
deep learning-based survival prediction models. The first strategy uses a
sparsity-inducing method while the second one uses importance based gene
selection for identifying relevant genes. Our overall approach leverages the
power of deep learning to model complex biological data structures, while
sparsity-inducing methods ensure the selection process focuses on the most
informative genes, minimizing noise and redundancy. Through comprehensive
experimentation on diverse genomic and survival datasets, we demonstrate that
our strategy not only identifies gene signatures with high predictive power for
survival outcomes but can also streamlines the process for low-cost genomic
profiling. The implications of this research are profound as it offers a
scalable and effective tool for advancing personalized medicine and targeted
cancer therapies. By pushing the boundaries of gene selection methodologies,
our work contributes significantly to the ongoing efforts in cancer genomics,
promising improved diagnostic and prognostic capabilities in clinical settings.

*Seunghyun Park, Seonwoo Min, Hyunsoo Choi, and Sungroh Yoon* 

  Since microRNAs (miRNAs) play a crucial role in post-transcriptional gene
regulation, miRNA identification is one of the most essential problems in
computational biology. miRNAs are usually short in length ranging between 20
and 23 base pairs. It is thus often difficult to distinguish miRNA-encoding
sequences from other non-coding RNAs and pseudo miRNAs that have a similar
length, and most previous studies have recommended using precursor miRNAs
instead of mature miRNAs for robust detection. A great number of conventional
machine-learning-based classification methods have been proposed, but they
often have the serious disadvantage of requiring manual feature engineering,
and their performance is limited as well. In this paper, we propose a novel
miRNA precursor prediction algorithm, deepMiRGene, based on recurrent neural
networks, specifically long short-term memory networks. deepMiRGene
automatically learns suitable features from the data themselves without manual
feature engineering and constructs a model that can successfully reflect
structural characteristics of precursor miRNAs. For the performance evaluation
of our approach, we have employed several widely used evaluation metrics on
three recent benchmark datasets and verified that deepMiRGene delivered
comparable performance among the current state-of-the-art tools.

*Fenglin Liu, Bang Yang, Chenyu You, Xian Wu, Shen Ge, Adelaide Woicik,  Sheng Wang* 

  Gene Ontology (GO) is the primary gene function knowledge base that enables
computational tasks in biomedicine. The basic element of GO is a term, which
includes a set of genes with the same function. Existing research efforts of GO
mainly focus on predicting gene term associations. Other tasks, such as
generating descriptions of new terms, are rarely pursued. In this paper, we
propose a novel task: GO term description generation. This task aims to
automatically generate a sentence that describes the function of a GO term
belonging to one of the three categories, i.e., molecular function, biological
process, and cellular component. To address this task, we propose a
Graph-in-Graph network that can efficiently leverage the structural information
of GO. The proposed network introduces a two-layer graph: the first layer is a
graph of GO terms where each node is also a graph (gene graph). Such a
Graph-in-Graph network can derive the biological functions of GO terms and
generate proper descriptions. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed
network, we build three large-scale benchmark datasets. By incorporating the
proposed Graph-in-Graph network, the performances of seven different
sequence-to-sequence models can be substantially boosted across all evaluation
metrics, with up to 34.7%, 14.5%, and 39.1% relative improvements in BLEU,
ROUGE-L, and METEOR, respectively.

  The intra- and inter-species genetic diversity of bacteria and the absence of
'reference', or the most representative, sequences of individual species
present a significant challenge for sequence-based identification. The aims of
this study were to determine the utility, and compare the performance of
several clustering and classification algorithms to identify the species of 364
sequences of 16S rRNA gene with a defined species in GenBank, and 110 sequences
of 16S rRNA gene with no defined species, all within the genus Nocardia. A
total of 364 16S rRNA gene sequences of Nocardia species were studied. In
addition, 110 16S rRNA gene sequences assigned only to the Nocardia genus level
at the time of submission to GenBank were used for machine learning
classification experiments. Different clustering algorithms were compared with
a novel algorithm or the linear mapping (LM) of the distance matrix. Principal
Components Analysis was used for the dimensionality reduction and
visualization. Results: The LM algorithm achieved the highest performance and
classified the set of 364 16S rRNA sequences into 80 clusters, the majority of
which (83.52%) corresponded with the original species. The most representative
16S rRNA sequences for individual Nocardia species have been identified as
'centroids' in respective clusters from which the distances to all other
sequences were minimized; 110 16S rRNA gene sequences with identifications
recorded only at the genus level were classified using machine learning
methods. Simple kNN machine learning demonstrated the highest performance and
classified Nocardia species sequences with an accuracy of 92.7% and a mean

individuals and their relationships. This is usually done by completing a
questionnaire containing different types of questions that will be later used
to obtain the SNA measures needed to perform the study. There are, then, a
great number of different possible network generating questions and also many
possibilities for mapping the responses to the corresponding characteristics
and relationships. Many variations may be introduced into these questions (the
way they are posed, the weights given to each of the responses, etc.) that may
have an effect on the resulting networks. All these different variations are
difficult to achieve manually, because the process is time-consuming and error
prone. The tool described in this paper uses semantic knowledge representation
techniques in order to facilitate this kind of sensitivity studies. The base of
the tool is a conceptual structure, called "ontology" that is able to represent
the different concepts and their definitions. The tool is compared to other
similar ones, and the advantages of the approach are highlighted, giving some
particular examples from an ongoing SNA study about alcohol consumption habits
in adolescents.

  The identification of cancer genes is a critical yet challenging problem in
cancer genomics research. Existing computational methods, including deep graph
neural networks, fail to exploit the multilayered gene-gene interactions or
provide limited explanation for their predictions. These methods are restricted
to a single biological network, which cannot capture the full complexity of
tumorigenesis. Models trained on different biological networks often yield
different and even opposite cancer gene predictions, hindering their
trustworthy adaptation. Here, we introduce an Explainable Multilayer Graph
Neural Network (EMGNN) approach to identify cancer genes by leveraging multiple
genegene interaction networks and pan-cancer multi-omics data. Unlike
conventional graph learning on a single biological network, EMGNN uses a
multilayered graph neural network to learn from multiple biological networks
for accurate cancer gene prediction. Our method consistently outperforms all
existing methods, with an average 7.15% improvement in area under the
precision-recall curve (AUPR) over the current state-of-the-art method.
Importantly, EMGNN integrated multiple graphs to prioritize newly predicted
cancer genes with conflicting predictions from single biological networks. For
each prediction, EMGNN provided valuable biological insights via both
model-level feature importance explanations and molecular-level gene set
enrichment analysis. Overall, EMGNN offers a powerful new paradigm of graph
learning through modeling the multilayered topological gene relationships and
provides a valuable tool for cancer genomics research.
