# Longevity therapy

Longevity therapy is a branch of medicine that deals with the extension of human life. It is a relatively new field, but it has already made significant progress in understanding the biological mechanisms of aging and developing treatments to slow down or reverse the aging process.

The goal of longevity therapy is not only to extend lifespan but also to improve healthspan, which is the period of life spent in good health. This is because simply living longer is not enough if those extra years are spent in poor health.

There are several approaches to longevity therapy, including:

1. Caloric restriction: This involves reducing daily caloric intake while still maintaining proper nutrition. Caloric restriction has been shown to extend lifespan in various organisms, including yeast, worms, flies, and mice.
2. Telomere lengthening: Telomeres are the protective caps on the ends of chromosomes that shorten as we age. Longevity therapies aimed at lengthening telomeres include the use of telomerase activators, which have been shown to slow down telomere shortening and improve cellular health.
3. Senolytics: Senolytics are drugs that selectively target and eliminate senescent cells, which are cells that have stopped dividing but still remain metabolically active. Senescent cells have been linked to aging and various age-related diseases, and eliminating them has been shown to improve healthspan and lifespan in animal models.
4. Stem cell therapy: Stem cells are undifferentiated cells that have the ability to differentiate into various cell types and have the potential to regenerate damaged tissues. Longevity therapies using stem cells aim to repair and regenerate damaged tissues, improve organ function, and slow down the aging process.
5. Gene therapy: Gene therapy involves the use of genes to treat or prevent diseases. In the context of longevity therapy, gene therapy can be used to modify genes associated with aging and age-related diseases. For example, gene therapy has been used to extend lifespan in mice by targeting genes involved in insulin signaling and DNA repair.

It's important to note that while these approaches have shown promise in animal models, more research is needed to determine their safety and efficacy

### 09 Mar 2022 | [Artificial Intelligence Solution for Effective Treatment Planning for  Glioblastoma Patients](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.05563) | [‚¨áÔ∏è](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.05563)
*Vikram Goddla* 

  Glioblastomas are the most common malignant brain tumors in adults.
Approximately 200000 people die each year from Glioblastoma in the world.
Glioblastoma patients have a median survival of 12 months with optimal therapy
and about 4 months without treatment. Glioblastomas appear as heterogeneous
necrotic masses with irregular peripheral enhancement, surrounded by vasogenic
edema. The current standard of care includes surgical resection, radiotherapy
and chemotherapy, which require accurate segmentation of brain tumor
subregions. For effective treatment planning, it is vital to identify the
methylation status of the promoter of Methylguanine Methyltransferase (MGMT), a
positive prognostic factor for chemotherapy. However, current methods for brain
tumor segmentation are tedious, subjective and not scalable, and current
techniques to determine the methylation status of MGMT promoter involve
surgically invasive procedures, which are expensive and time consuming. Hence
there is a pressing need to develop automated tools to segment brain tumors and
non-invasive methods to predict methylation status of MGMT promoter, to
facilitate better treatment planning and improve survival rate. I created an
integrated diagnostics solution powered by Artificial Intelligence to
automatically segment brain tumor subregions and predict MGMT promoter
methylation status, using brain MRI scans. My AI solution is proven on large
datasets with performance exceeding current standards and field tested with
data from teaching files of local neuroradiologists. With my solution,
physicians can submit brain MRI images, and get segmentation and methylation
predictions in minutes, and guide brain tumor patients with effective treatment
planning and ultimately improve survival time.

*Walia Farzana, Mustafa M Basree, Norou Diawara, Zeina A. Shboul, Sagel  Dubey, Marie M Lockhart, Mohamed Hamza, Joshua D. Palmer, Khan M.  Iftekharuddin* 

  Recent clinical research describes a subset of glioblastoma patients that
exhibit REP prior to start of radiation therapy. Current literature has thus
far described this population using clinicopathologic features. To our
knowledge, this study is the first to investigate the potential of conventional
ra-diomics, sophisticated multi-resolution fractal texture features, and
different molecular features (MGMT, IDH mutations) as a diagnostic and
prognostic tool for prediction of REP from non-REP cases using computational
and statistical modeling methods. Radiation-planning T1 post-contrast (T1C) MRI
sequences of 70 patients are analyzed. Ensemble method with 5-fold cross
validation over 1000 iterations offers AUC of 0.793 with standard deviation of
0.082 for REP and non-REP classification. In addition, copula-based modeling
under dependent censoring (where a subset of the patients may not be followed
up until death) identifies significant features (p-value <0.05) for survival
probability and prognostic grouping of patient cases. The prediction of
survival for the patients cohort produces precision of 0.881 with standard
deviation of 0.056. The prognostic index (PI) calculated using the fused
features suggests that 84.62% of REP cases fall under the bad prognostic group,
suggesting potentiality of fused features to predict a higher percentage of REP
cases. The experimental result further shows that mul-ti-resolution fractal
texture features perform better than conventional radiomics features for REP
and survival outcomes.

*Amr Hagag, Ahmed Gomaa, Dominik Kornek, Andreas Maier, Rainer Fietkau,  Christoph Bert, Florian Putz and Yixing Huang* 

  Survival prediction for cancer patients is critical for optimal treatment
selection and patient management. Current patient survival prediction methods
typically extract survival information from patients' clinical record data or
biological and imaging data. In practice, experienced clinicians can have a
preliminary assessment of patients' health status based on patients' observable
physical appearances, which are mainly facial features. However, such
assessment is highly subjective. In this work, the efficacy of objectively
capturing and using prognostic information contained in conventional portrait
photographs using deep learning for survival predication purposes is
investigated for the first time. A pre-trained StyleGAN2 model is fine-tuned on
a custom dataset of our cancer patients' photos to empower its generator with
generative ability suitable for patients' photos. The StyleGAN2 is then used to
embed the photographs to its highly expressive latent space. Utilizing the
state-of-the-art survival analysis models and based on StyleGAN's latent space
photo embeddings, this approach achieved a C-index of 0.677, which is notably
higher than chance and evidencing the prognostic value embedded in simple 2D
facial images. In addition, thanks to StyleGAN's interpretable latent space,
our survival prediction model can be validated for relying on essential facial
features, eliminating any biases from extraneous information like clothing or
background. Moreover, a health attribute is obtained from regression
coefficients, which has important potential value for patient care.

*Niranjan Balachandar, Christine Liu, Winston Wang* 

  The current state of cancer therapeutics has been moving away from
one-size-fits-all cytotoxic chemotherapy, and towards a more individualized and
specific approach involving the targeting of each tumor's genetic
vulnerabilities. Different tumors, even of the same type, may be more reliant
on certain cellular pathways more than others. With modern advancements in our
understanding of cancer genome sequencing, these pathways can be discovered.
Investigating each of the millions of possible small molecule inhibitors for
each kinase in vitro, however, would be extremely expensive and time consuming.
This project focuses on predicting the inhibition activity of small molecules
targeting 8 different kinases using multiple deep learning models. We trained
fingerprint-based MLPs and simplified molecular-input line-entry specification
(SMILES)-based recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and molecular graph
convolutional networks (GCNs) to accurately predict inhibitory activity
targeting these 8 kinases.

### 18 Oct 2019 | [Personalized Treatment for Coronary Artery Disease Patients: A Machine  Learning Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.08483) | [‚¨áÔ∏è](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.08483)
*Dimitris Bertsimas, Agni Orfanoudaki, Rory B. Weiner* 

  Current clinical practice guidelines for managing Coronary Artery Disease
(CAD) account for general cardiovascular risk factors. However, they do not
present a framework that considers personalized patient-specific
characteristics. Using the electronic health records of 21,460 patients, we
created data-driven models for personalized CAD management that significantly
improve health outcomes relative to the standard of care. We develop binary
classifiers to detect whether a patient will experience an adverse event due to
CAD within a 10-year time frame. Combining the patients' medical history and
clinical examination results, we achieve 81.5% AUC. For each treatment, we also
create a series of regression models that are based on different supervised
machine learning algorithms. We are able to estimate with average R squared =
0.801 the time from diagnosis to a potential adverse event (TAE) and gain
accurate approximations of the counterfactual treatment effects. Leveraging
combinations of these models, we present ML4CAD, a novel personalized
prescriptive algorithm. Considering the recommendations of multiple predictive
models at once, ML4CAD identifies for every patient the therapy with the best
expected outcome using a voting mechanism. We evaluate its performance by
measuring the prescription effectiveness and robustness under alternative
ground truths. We show that our methodology improves the expected TAE upon the
current baseline by 24.11%, increasing it from 4.56 to 5.66 years. The
algorithm performs particularly well for the male (24.3% improvement) and
Hispanic (58.41% improvement) subpopulations. Finally, we create an interactive
interface, providing physicians with an intuitive, accurate, readily
implementable, and effective tool.

### 06 May 2022 | [RCMNet: A deep learning model assists CAR-T therapy for leukemia](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.04230) | [‚¨áÔ∏è](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.04230)
*Ruitao Zhang, Xueying Han, Ijaz Gul, Shiyao Zhai, Ying Liu, Yongbing  Zhang, Yuhan Dong, Lan Ma, Dongmei Yu, Jin Zhou, Peiwu Qin* 

  Acute leukemia is a type of blood cancer with a high mortality rate. Current
therapeutic methods include bone marrow transplantation, supportive therapy,
and chemotherapy. Although a satisfactory remission of the disease can be
achieved, the risk of recurrence is still high. Therefore, novel treatments are
demanding. Chimeric antigen receptor-T (CAR-T) therapy has emerged as a
promising approach to treat and cure acute leukemia. To harness the therapeutic
potential of CAR-T cell therapy for blood diseases, reliable cell morphological
identification is crucial. Nevertheless, the identification of CAR-T cells is a
big challenge posed by their phenotypic similarity with other blood cells. To
address this substantial clinical challenge, herein we first construct a CAR-T
dataset with 500 original microscopy images after staining. Following that, we
create a novel integrated model called RCMNet (ResNet18 with CBAM and MHSA)
that combines the convolutional neural network (CNN) and Transformer. The model
shows 99.63% top-1 accuracy on the public dataset. Compared with previous
reports, our model obtains satisfactory results for image classification.
Although testing on the CAR-T cells dataset, a decent performance is observed,
which is attributed to the limited size of the dataset. Transfer learning is
adapted for RCMNet and a maximum of 83.36% accuracy has been achieved, which is
higher than other SOTA models. The study evaluates the effectiveness of RCMNet
on a big public dataset and translates it to a clinical dataset for diagnostic
applications.

### 24 Apr 2023 | [Predicting Pulmonary Hypertension by Electrocardiograms Using Machine  Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12447) | [‚¨áÔ∏è](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.12447)
*Eashan Kosaraju, Praveen Kumar Pandian Shanmuganathan* 

  Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a condition of high blood pressure that
affects the arteries in the lungs and the right side of the heart (Mayo Clinic,
2017). A mean pulmonary artery pressure greater than 25 mmHg is defined as
Pulmonary hypertension. The estimated 5-year survival rate from the time of
diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension is only 57% without therapy and patients
with right heart failure only survive for approximately 1 year without
treatment (Benza et al., 2012). Given the indolent nature of the disease, early
detection of PH remains a challenge leading to delays in therapy.
Echocardiography is currently used as a screening tool for diagnosing PH.
However, electrocardiography (ECG), a more accessible, simple to use, and
cost-effective tool compared to echocardiography, is less studied and explored
for screening at-risk patients for PH. The goal of this project is to create a
neural network model which can process an ECG signal and detect the presence of
PH with a confidence probability. I created a dense neural network (DNN) model
that has an accuracy of 98% over the available training sample. For future
steps, the current model will be updated with a model suited for time-series
data. To balance the dataset with proper training samples, I will generate
additional data using data augmentation techniques. Through early and accurate
detection of conditions such as PH, we widen the spectrum of innovation in
detecting chronic life-threatening health conditions and reduce associated
mortality and morbidity.

*Muskan Garg* 

  During the current mental health crisis, the importance of identifying
potential indicators of mental issues from social media content has surged.
Overlooking the multifaceted nature of mental and social well-being can have
detrimental effects on one's mental state. In traditional therapy sessions,
professionals manually pinpoint the origins and outcomes of underlying mental
challenges, a process both detailed and time-intensive. We introduce an
approach to this intricate mental health analysis by framing the identification
of wellness dimensions in Reddit content as a wellness concept extraction and
categorization challenge. We've curated a unique dataset named WELLXPLAIN,
comprising 3,092 entries and totaling 72,813 words. Drawing from Halbert L.
Dunn's well-regarded wellness theory, our team formulated an annotation
framework along with guidelines. This dataset also includes human-marked
textual segments, offering clear reasoning for decisions made in the wellness
concept categorization process. Our aim in publishing this dataset and
analyzing initial benchmarks is to spearhead the creation of advanced language
models tailored for healthcare-focused concept extraction and categorization.

### 13 Oct 2021 | [Metaparametric Neural Networks for Survival Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.06610) | [‚¨áÔ∏è](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.06610)

  Survival analysis is a critical tool for the modelling of time-to-event data,
such as life expectancy after a cancer diagnosis or optimal maintenance
scheduling for complex machinery. However, current neural network models
provide an imperfect solution for survival analysis as they either restrict the
shape of the target probability distribution or restrict the estimation to
pre-determined times. As a consequence, current survival neural networks lack
the ability to estimate a generic function without prior knowledge of its
structure. In this article, we present the metaparametric neural network
framework that encompasses existing survival analysis methods and enables their
extension to solve the aforementioned issues. This framework allows survival
neural networks to satisfy the same independence of generic function estimation
from the underlying data structure that characterizes their regression and
classification counterparts. Further, we demonstrate the application of the
metaparametric framework using both simulated and large real-world datasets and
show that it outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods in (i) capturing
nonlinearities, and (ii) identifying temporal patterns, leading to more
accurate overall estimations whilst placing no restrictions on the underlying
function structure.

*Elizaveta Savchenko, Ariel Rosenfeld, Svetlana Bunimovich-Mendrazitsky* 

  Cancer is one of the most widespread diseases around the world with millions
of new patients each year. Bladder cancer is one of the most prevalent types of
cancer affecting all individuals alike with no obvious prototypical patient.
The current standard treatment for BC follows a routine weekly Bacillus
Calmette-Guerin (BCG) immunotherapy-based therapy protocol which is applied to
all patients alike. The clinical outcomes associated with BCG treatment vary
significantly among patients due to the biological and clinical complexity of
the interaction between the immune system, treatments, and cancer cells. In
this study, we take advantage of the patient's socio-demographics to offer a
personalized mathematical model that describes the clinical dynamics associated
with BCG-based treatment. To this end, we adopt a well-established BCG
treatment model and integrate a machine learning component to temporally adjust
and reconfigure key parameters within the model thus promoting its
personalization. Using real clinical data, we show that our personalized model
favorably compares with the original one in predicting the number of cancer
cells at the end of the treatment, with 14.8% improvement, on average.

*Yunhui Guo, Mingrui Liu, Tianbao Yang, Tajana Rosing* 

  Current deep neural networks can achieve remarkable performance on a single
task. However, when the deep neural network is continually trained on a
sequence of tasks, it seems to gradually forget the previous learned knowledge.
This phenomenon is referred to as \textit{catastrophic forgetting} and
motivates the field called lifelong learning. Recently, episodic memory based
approaches such as GEM \cite{lopez2017gradient} and A-GEM
\cite{chaudhry2018efficient} have shown remarkable performance. In this paper,
we provide the first unified view of episodic memory based approaches from an
optimization's perspective. This view leads to two improved schemes for
episodic memory based lifelong learning, called MEGA-I and MEGA-II. MEGA-I and
MEGA-II modulate the balance between old tasks and the new task by integrating
the current gradient with the gradient computed on the episodic memory.
Notably, we show that GEM and A-GEM are degenerate cases of MEGA-I and MEGA-II
which consistently put the same emphasis on the current task, regardless of how
the loss changes over time. Our proposed schemes address this issue by using
novel loss-balancing updating rules, which drastically improve the performance
over GEM and A-GEM. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed
schemes significantly advance the state-of-the-art on four commonly used
lifelong learning benchmarks, reducing the error by up to 18\%.

### 26 Apr 2022 | [RadioPathomics: Multimodal Learning in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer for  Adaptive Radiotherapy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.12423) | [‚¨áÔ∏è](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.12423)
*Matteo Tortora, Ermanno Cordelli, Rosa Sicilia, Lorenzo Nibid, Edy  Ippolito, Giuseppe Perrone, Sara Ramella and Paolo Soda* 

  The current cancer treatment practice collects multimodal data, such as
radiology images, histopathology slides, genomics and clinical data. The
importance of these data sources taken individually has fostered the recent
raise of radiomics and pathomics, i.e. the extraction of quantitative features
from radiology and histopathology images routinely collected to predict
clinical outcomes or to guide clinical decisions using artificial intelligence
algorithms. Nevertheless, how to combine them into a single multimodal
framework is still an open issue. In this work we therefore develop a
multimodal late fusion approach that combines hand-crafted features computed
from radiomics, pathomics and clinical data to predict radiation therapy
treatment outcomes for non-small-cell lung cancer patients. Within this
context, we investigate eight different late fusion rules (i.e. product,
maximum, minimum, mean, decision template, Dempster-Shafer, majority voting,
and confidence rule) and two patient-wise aggregation rules leveraging the
richness of information given by computer tomography images and whole-slide
scans. The experiments in leave-one-patient-out cross-validation on an in-house
cohort of 33 patients show that the proposed multimodal paradigm with an AUC
equal to $90.9\%$ outperforms each unimodal approach, suggesting that data
integration can advance precision medicine. As a further contribution, we also
compare the hand-crafted representations with features automatically computed
by deep networks, and the late fusion paradigm with early fusion, another
popular multimodal approach. In both cases, the experiments show that the
proposed multimodal approach provides the best results.

*Francesco Fiz, Helmut Dittmann, Cristina Campi, Matthias Weissinger,  Samine Sahbai, Matthias Reimold, Arnulf Stenzl, Michele Piana, Gianmario  Sambuceti, Christian la Foug\`ere* 

  To meet the current need for skeletal tumor-load estimation in prostate
cancer (mCRPC), we developed a novel approach, based on adaptive bone
segmentation. In this study, we compared the program output with existing
estimates and with the radiological outcome. Seventy-six whole-body
99mTc-DPD-SPECT/CT from mCRPC patients were analyzed. The software identified
the whole skeletal volume (SVol) and classified it voxels metastases (MVol) or
normal bone (BVol). SVol was compared with the estimation of a commercial
software. MVol was compared with manual assessment and with PSA-level.
Counts/voxel were extracted from MVol and BVol. After six cycles of
223RaCl2-therapy every patient was re-evaluated as progressing (PD), stabilized
(SD) or responsive (PR). SVol correlated with the one of the commercial
software (R=0,99, p<0,001). MVol correlated with manually-counted lesions
(R=0,61, p<0,001) and PSA (R=0,46, p<0.01). PD had a lower counts/voxel in MVol
than PR/SD (715 \pm 190 Vs. 975 \pm 215 and 1058 \pm 255, p<0,05 and p<0,01)
and in BVol (PD 275 \pm 60, PR 515 \pm 188 and SD 528 \pm 162 counts/voxel,
p<0,001). Segmentation-based tumor load correlated with radiological/laboratory
indices. Uptake was linked with the clinical outcome, suggesting that
metastases in PD patients have a lower affinity for bone-seeking radionuclides
and might benefit less from bone-targeted radioisotope therapies.

*Xiaoye Michael Wang, Derek T. Smith, Qin Zhu* 

  Background. Joint range of motion (ROM) is an important quantitative measure
for physical therapy. Commonly relying on a goniometer, accurate and reliable
ROM measurement requires extensive training and practice. This, in turn,
imposes a significant barrier for those who have limited in-person access to
healthcare.
  Objective. The current study presents and evaluates an alternative machine
learning-based ROM evaluation method that could be remotely accessed via a
webcam.
  Methods. To evaluate its reliability, the ROM measurements for a diverse set
of joints (neck, spine, and upper and lower extremities) derived using this
method were compared to those obtained from a marker-based optical motion
capture system.
  Results. Data collected from 25 healthy adults demonstrated that the webcam
solution exhibited high test-retest reliability, with substantial to almost
perfect intraclass correlation coefficients for most joints. Compared with the
marker-based system, the webcam-based system demonstrated substantial to almost
perfect inter-rater reliability for some joints, and lower inter-rater
reliability for other joints (e.g., shoulder flexion and elbow flexion), which
could be attributed to the reduced sensitivity to joint locations at the apex
of the movement.
  Conclusions. The proposed webcam-based method exhibited high test-retest and
inter-rater reliability, making it a versatile alternative for existing ROM
evaluation methods in clinical practice and the tele-implementation of physical
therapy and rehabilitation.

*Xiaofeng Liu, Nadya Shusharina, Helen A Shih, C.-C. Jay Kuo, Georges  El Fakhri, Jonghye Woo* 

  In this work, we aim to predict the survival time (ST) of glioblastoma (GBM)
patients undergoing different treatments based on preoperative magnetic
resonance (MR) scans. The personalized and precise treatment planning can be
achieved by comparing the ST of different treatments. It is well established
that both the current status of the patient (as represented by the MR scans)
and the choice of treatment are the cause of ST. While previous related
MR-based glioblastoma ST studies have focused only on the direct mapping of MR
scans to ST, they have not included the underlying causal relationship between
treatments and ST. To address this limitation, we propose a
treatment-conditioned regression model for glioblastoma ST that incorporates
treatment information in addition to MR scans. Our approach allows us to
effectively utilize the data from all of the treatments in a unified manner,
rather than having to train separate models for each of the treatments.
Furthermore, treatment can be effectively injected into each convolutional
layer through the adaptive instance normalization we employ. We evaluate our
framework on the BraTS20 ST prediction task. Three treatment options are
considered: Gross Total Resection (GTR), Subtotal Resection (STR), and no
resection. The evaluation results demonstrate the effectiveness of injecting
the treatment for estimating GBM survival.

*Hexin Dong, Jiawen Yao, Yuxing Tang, Mingze Yuan, Yingda Xia, Jian  Zhou, Hong Lu, Jingren Zhou, Bin Dong, Le Lu, Li Zhang, Zaiyi Liu, Yu Shi,  Ling Zhang* 

  Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly lethal cancer in which
the tumor-vascular involvement greatly affects the resectability and, thus,
overall survival of patients. However, current prognostic prediction methods
fail to explicitly and accurately investigate relationships between the tumor
and nearby important vessels. This paper proposes a novel learnable neural
distance that describes the precise relationship between the tumor and vessels
in CT images of different patients, adopting it as a major feature for
prognosis prediction. Besides, different from existing models that used CNNs or
LSTMs to exploit tumor enhancement patterns on dynamic contrast-enhanced CT
imaging, we improved the extraction of dynamic tumor-related texture features
in multi-phase contrast-enhanced CT by fusing local and global features using
CNN and transformer modules, further enhancing the features extracted across
multi-phase CT images. We extensively evaluated and compared the proposed
method with existing methods in the multi-center (n=4) dataset with 1,070
patients with PDAC, and statistical analysis confirmed its clinical
effectiveness in the external test set consisting of three centers. The
developed risk marker was the strongest predictor of overall survival among
preoperative factors and it has the potential to be combined with established
clinical factors to select patients at higher risk who might benefit from
neoadjuvant therapy.

*Yasir Ghunaim, Adel Bibi, Kumail Alhamoud, Motasem Alfarra, Hasan Abed  Al Kader Hammoud, Ameya Prabhu, Philip H. S. Torr, Bernard Ghanem* 

  Current evaluations of Continual Learning (CL) methods typically assume that
there is no constraint on training time and computation. This is an unrealistic
assumption for any real-world setting, which motivates us to propose: a
practical real-time evaluation of continual learning, in which the stream does
not wait for the model to complete training before revealing the next data for
predictions. To do this, we evaluate current CL methods with respect to their
computational costs. We conduct extensive experiments on CLOC, a large-scale
dataset containing 39 million time-stamped images with geolocation labels. We
show that a simple baseline outperforms state-of-the-art CL methods under this
evaluation, questioning the applicability of existing methods in realistic
settings. In addition, we explore various CL components commonly used in the
literature, including memory sampling strategies and regularization approaches.
We find that all considered methods fail to be competitive against our simple
baseline. This surprisingly suggests that the majority of existing CL
literature is tailored to a specific class of streams that is not practical. We
hope that the evaluation we provide will be the first step towards a paradigm
shift to consider the computational cost in the development of online continual
learning methods.

*Yeldar Toleubay, Don Joven Agravante, Daiki Kimura, Baihan Lin,  Djallel Bouneffouf, Michiaki Tatsubori* 

  In response to the global challenge of mental health problems, we proposes a
Logical Neural Network (LNN) based Neuro-Symbolic AI method for the diagnosis
of mental disorders. Due to the lack of effective therapy coverage for mental
disorders, there is a need for an AI solution that can assist therapists with
the diagnosis. However, current Neural Network models lack explainability and
may not be trusted by therapists. The LNN is a Recurrent Neural Network
architecture that combines the learning capabilities of neural networks with
the reasoning capabilities of classical logic-based AI. The proposed system
uses input predicates from clinical interviews to output a mental disorder
class, and different predicate pruning techniques are used to achieve
scalability and higher scores. In addition, we provide an insight extraction
method to aid therapists with their diagnosis. The proposed system addresses
the lack of explainability of current Neural Network models and provides a more
trustworthy solution for mental disorder diagnosis.

  Interest in physical therapy and individual exercises such as yoga/dance has
increased alongside the well-being trend. However, such exercises are hard to
follow without expert guidance (which is impossible to scale for personalized
feedback to every trainee remotely). Thus, automated pose correction systems
are required more than ever, and we introduce a new captioning dataset named
FixMyPose to address this need. We collect descriptions of correcting a
"current" pose to look like a "target" pose (in both English and Hindi). The
collected descriptions have interesting linguistic properties such as
egocentric relations to environment objects, analogous references, etc.,
requiring an understanding of spatial relations and commonsense knowledge about
postures. Further, to avoid ML biases, we maintain a balance across characters
with diverse demographics, who perform a variety of movements in several
interior environments (e.g., homes, offices). From our dataset, we introduce
the pose-correctional-captioning task and its reverse target-pose-retrieval
task. During the correctional-captioning task, models must generate
descriptions of how to move from the current to target pose image, whereas in
the retrieval task, models should select the correct target pose given the
initial pose and correctional description. We present strong cross-attention
baseline models (uni/multimodal, RL, multilingual) and also show that our
baselines are competitive with other models when evaluated on other
image-difference datasets. We also propose new task-specific metrics
(object-match, body-part-match, direction-match) and conduct human evaluation
for more reliable evaluation, and we demonstrate a large human-model
performance gap suggesting room for promising future work. To verify the
sim-to-real transfer of our FixMyPose dataset, we collect a set of real images
and show promising performance on these images.

### 25 Oct 2023 | [Early Detection of Tuberculosis with Machine Learning Cough Audio  Analysis: Towards More Accessible Global Triaging Usage](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17675) | [‚¨áÔ∏è](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.17675)

  Tuberculosis (TB), a bacterial disease mainly affecting the lungs, is one of
the leading infectious causes of mortality worldwide. To prevent TB from
spreading within the body, which causes life-threatening complications, timely
and effective anti-TB treatment is crucial. Cough, an objective biomarker for
TB, is a triage tool that monitors treatment response and regresses with
successful therapy. Current gold standards for TB diagnosis are slow or
inaccessible, especially in rural areas where TB is most prevalent. In
addition, current machine learning (ML) diagnosis research, like utilizing
chest radiographs, is ineffective and does not monitor treatment progression.
To enable effective diagnosis, an ensemble model was developed that analyzes,
using a novel ML architecture, coughs' acoustic epidemiologies from
smartphones' microphones to detect TB. The architecture includes a 2D-CNN and
XGBoost that was trained on 724,964 cough audio samples and demographics from 7
countries. After feature extraction (Mel-spectrograms) and data augmentation
(IR-convolution), the model achieved AUROC (area under the receiving operator
characteristic) of 88%, surpassing WHO's requirements for screening tests. The
results are available within 15 seconds and can easily be accessible via a
mobile app. This research helps to improve TB diagnosis through a promising
accurate, quick, and accessible triaging tool.
