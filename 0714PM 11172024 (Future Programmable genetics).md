*Shu Guo (1 and 2), Lin Pang (1 and 2) ((1) College of Physics, Sichuan  University, (2) LinOptx LLC)* 

  We develop an accelerated Genetic Algorithm (GA) system constructed by the
cooperation of field-programmable gate array (FPGA) and optimized parameters of
the GA. We found the enhanced decay of mutation rate makes convergence of the
GA much faster, enabling the parameter-induced acceleration of the GA.
Furthermore, the accelerated configuration of the GA is programmed in FPGA to
boost processing speed at the hardware level without external computation
devices. This system has ability to focus light through scattering medium
within 4 seconds with robust noise resistance and stable repetition
performance, which could be further reduced to millisecond level with advanced
board configuration. This study solves the long-term limitation of the GA, it
promotes the applications of the GA in dynamic scattering mediums, with the
capability to tackle wavefront shaping in biological material.

*Matheus F. Torquato and Marcelo A. C. Fernandes* 

  Genetic Algorithms (GAs) are used to solve search and optimization problems
in which an optimal solution can be found using an iterative process with
probabilistic and non-deterministic transitions. However, depending on the
problem's nature, the time required to find a solution can be high in
sequential machines due to the computational complexity of genetic algorithms.
This work proposes a parallel implementation of a genetic algorithm on
field-programmable gate array (FPGA). Optimization of the system's processing
time is the main goal of this project. Results associated with the processing
time and area occupancy (on FPGA) for various population sizes are analyzed.
Studies concerning the accuracy of the GA response for the optimization of two
variables functions were also evaluated for the hardware implementation.
However, the high-performance implementation proposes in this paper is able to
work with more variable from some adjustments on hardware architecture.

*Tao Yu, Zongdian Li, Kei Sakaguchi, Omar Hashash, Walid Saad, Merouane  Debbah* 

  The concept of digital twin (DT), which enables the creation of a
programmable, digital representation of physical systems, is expected to
revolutionize future industries and will lie at the heart of the vision of a
future smart society, namely, Society 5.0, in which high integration between
cyber (digital) and physical spaces is exploited to bring economic and societal
advancements. However, the success of such a DT-driven Society 5.0 requires a
synergistic convergence of artificial intelligence and networking technologies
into an integrated, programmable system that can coordinate networks of DTs to
effectively deliver diverse Society 5.0 services. Prior works remain restricted
to either qualitative study, simple analysis or software implementations of a
single DT, and thus, they cannot provide the highly synergistic integration of
digital and physical spaces as required by Society 5.0. In contrast, this paper
envisions a novel concept of an Internet of Federated Digital Twins (IoFDT)
that holistically integrates heterogeneous and physically separated DTs
representing different Society 5.0 services within a single framework and
system. For this concept of IoFDT, we first introduce a hierarchical
architecture that integrates federated DTs through horizontal and vertical
interactions, bridging the cyber and physical spaces to unlock new
possibilities. Then, we discuss the challenges of realizing IoFDT, highlighting
the intricacies across communication, computing, and AI-native networks while
also underscoring potential innovative solutions. Subsequently, we elaborate on
the importance of the implementation of a unified IoFDT platform that
integrates all technical components and orchestrates their interactions,
emphasizing the necessity of practical experimental platforms with a focus on
real-world applications in areas like smart mobility.

*Aymeric Vie, Alissa M. Kleinnijenhuis, Doyne J. Farmer* 

  Genetic algorithms, computer programs that simulate natural evolution, are
increasingly applied across many disciplines. They have been used to solve
various optimisation problems from neural network architecture search to
strategic games, and to model phenomena of adaptation and learning. Expertise
on the qualities and drawbacks of this technique is largely scattered across
the literature or former, motivating an compilation of this knowledge at the
light of the most recent developments of the field. In this review, we present
genetic algorithms, their qualities, limitations and challenges, as well as
some future development perspectives. Genetic algorithms are capable of
exploring large and complex spaces of possible solutions, to quickly locate
promising elements, and provide an adequate modelling tool to describe
evolutionary systems, from games to economies. They however suffer from high
computation costs, difficult parameter configuration, and crucial
representation of the solutions. Recent developments such as GPU, parallel and
quantum computing, conception of powerful parameter control methods, and novel
approaches in representation strategies, may be keys to overcome those
limitations. This compiling review aims at informing practitioners and
newcomers in the field alike in their genetic algorithm research, and at
outlining promising avenues for future research. It highlights the potential
for interdisciplinary research associating genetic algorithms to pulse original
discoveries in social sciences, open ended evolution, artificial life and AI.

*Paula Maddigan, Andrew Lensen, Bing Xue* 

  Genetic programming (GP) has the potential to generate explainable results,
especially when used for dimensionality reduction. In this research, we
investigate the potential of leveraging eXplainable AI (XAI) and large language
models (LLMs) like ChatGPT to improve the interpretability of GP-based
non-linear dimensionality reduction. Our study introduces a novel XAI dashboard
named GP4NLDR, the first approach to combine state-of-the-art GP with an
LLM-powered chatbot to provide comprehensive, user-centred explanations. We
showcase the system's ability to provide intuitive and insightful narratives on
high-dimensional data reduction processes through case studies. Our study
highlights the importance of prompt engineering in eliciting accurate and
pertinent responses from LLMs. We also address important considerations around
data privacy, hallucinatory outputs, and the rapid advancements in generative
AI. Our findings demonstrate its potential in advancing the explainability of
GP algorithms. This opens the door for future research into explaining GP
models with LLMs.

*Asifullah Khan, Aqsa Saeed Qureshi, Noorul Wahab, Mutawara Hussain,  and Muhammad Yousaf Hamza* 

  Genetic Programming (GP) has been primarily used to tackle optimization,
classification, and feature selection related tasks. The widespread use of GP
is due to its flexible and comprehensible tree-type structure. Similarly,
research is also gaining momentum in the field of Image Processing, because of
its promising results over vast areas of applications ranging from medical
Image Processing to multispectral imaging. Image Processing is mainly involved
in applications such as computer vision, pattern recognition, image
compression, storage, and medical diagnostics. This universal nature of images
and their associated algorithm, i.e., complexities, gave an impetus to the
exploration of GP. GP has thus been used in different ways for Image Processing
since its inception. Many interesting GP techniques have been developed and
employed in the field of Image Processing, and consequently, we aim to provide
the research community an extensive view of these techniques. This survey thus
presents the diverse applications of GP in Image Processing and provides useful
resources for further research. Also, the comparison of different parameters
used in different applications of Image Processing is summarized in tabular
form. Moreover, analysis of the different parameters used in Image Processing
related tasks is carried-out to save the time needed in the future for
evaluating the parameters of GP. As more advancement is made in GP
methodologies, its success in solving complex tasks, not only in Image
Processing but also in other fields, may increase. Additionally, guidelines are
provided for applying GP in Image Processing related tasks, the pros and cons
of GP techniques are discussed, and some future directions are also set.

*Dominik Sobania, Martin Briesch, Franz Rothlauf* 

  GitHub Copilot, an extension for the Visual Studio Code development
environment powered by the large-scale language model Codex, makes automatic
program synthesis available for software developers. This model has been
extensively studied in the field of deep learning, however, a comparison to
genetic programming, which is also known for its performance in automatic
program synthesis, has not yet been carried out. In this paper, we evaluate
GitHub Copilot on standard program synthesis benchmark problems and compare the
achieved results with those from the genetic programming literature. In
addition, we discuss the performance of both approaches. We find that the
performance of the two approaches on the benchmark problems is quite similar,
however, in comparison to GitHub Copilot, the program synthesis approaches
based on genetic programming are not yet mature enough to support programmers
in practical software development. Genetic programming usually needs a huge
amount of expensive hand-labeled training cases and takes too much time to
generate solutions. Furthermore, source code generated by genetic programming
approaches is often bloated and difficult to understand. For future work on
program synthesis with genetic programming, we suggest researchers to focus on
improving the execution time, readability, and usability.

*Francisco Fern\'andez de Vega, Gustavo Olague, Francisco Ch\'avez,  Daniel Lanza, Wolfgang Banzhaf, and Erik Goodman* 

  The present and future of evolutionary algorithms depends on the proper use
of modern parallel and distributed computing infrastructures. Although still
sequential approaches dominate the landscape, available multi-core, many-core
and distributed systems will make users and researchers to more frequently
deploy parallel version of the algorithms. In such a scenario, new
possibilities arise regarding the time saved when parallel evaluation of
individuals are performed. And this time saving is particularly relevant in
Genetic Programming. This paper studies how evaluation time influences not only
time to solution in parallel/distributed systems, but may also affect size
evolution of individuals in the population, and eventually will reduce the
bloat phenomenon GP features. This paper considers time and space as two sides
of a single coin when devising a more natural method for fighting bloat. This
new perspective allows us to understand that new methods for bloat control can
be derived, and the first of such a method is described and tested.
Experimental data confirms the strength of the approach: using computing time
as a measure of individuals' complexity allows to control the growth in size of
genetic programming individuals.

*Sihao Huang* 

  Artificial neurons built on synthetic gene networks have potential
applications ranging from complex cellular decision-making to bioreactor
regulation. Furthermore, due to the high information throughput of natural
systems, it provides an interesting candidate for biologically-based
supercomputing and analog simulations of traditionally intractable problems. In
this paper, we propose an architecture for constructing multicellular neural
networks and programmable nonlinear systems. We design an artificial neuron
based on gene regulatory networks and optimize its dynamics for modularity.
Using gene expression models, we simulate its ability to perform arbitrary
linear classifications from multiple inputs. Finally, we construct a two-layer
neural network to demonstrate scalability and nonlinear decision boundaries and
discuss future directions for utilizing uncontrolled neurons in computational
tasks.

*Mekaal Swerhun, Jasmine Foley, Brandon Massop and Vijay Mago* 

  In recent years, machine learning has seen an increasing presencein a large
variety of fields, especially in health care and bioinformatics.More
specifically, the field where machine learning algorithms have found most
applications is Genetic Algorithms.The objective of this paper is to conduct a
survey of articles published from 2015 onwards that deal with Genetic
Algorithms(GA) and how they are used in bioinformatics.To achieve the
objective, a scoping review was conducted that utilized Google Scholar
alongside Publish or Perish and the Scimago Journal & CountryRank to search for
respectable sources. Upon analyzing 31 articles from the field of
bioinformatics, it became apparent that genetic algorithms rarely form a full
application, instead they rely on other vital algorithms such as support vector
machines.Indeed, support vector machines were the most prevalent algorithms
used alongside genetic algorithms; however, while the usage of such algorithms
contributes to the heavy focus on accuracy by GA programs, it often sidelines
computation times in the process. In fact, most applications employing GAs for
classification and feature selectionare nearing or at 100% success rate, and
the focus of future GA development should be directed elsewhere.
Population-based searches, like GA, are often combined with other machine
learning algorithms. In this scoping review, genetic algorithms combined with
Support Vector Machines were found to perform best. The performance metric that
was evaluated most often was accuracy. Measuring the accuracy avoids measuring
the main weakness of GAs, which is computational time. The future of genetic
algorithms could be open-ended evolutionary algorithms, which attempt to
increase complexity and find diverse solutions, rather than optimize a fitness
function and converge to a single best solution from the initial population of
solutions.

*Hao Xu, Yuntian Chen, Zhenzhong Zeng, Nina Li, Jian Li, Dongxiao Zhang* 

  Despite the remarkable strides made by AI-driven models in modern
precipitation forecasting, these black-box models cannot inherently deepen the
comprehension of underlying mechanisms. To address this limitation, we propose
an AI-driven knowledge discovery framework known as genetic
algorithm-geographic weighted regression (GA-GWR). Our approach seeks to unveil
the explicit equations that govern the intricate relationship between
precipitation patterns and terrain characteristics in regions marked by complex
terrain. Through this AI-driven knowledge discovery, we uncover previously
undisclosed explicit equations that shed light on the connection between
terrain features and precipitation patterns. These equations demonstrate
remarkable accuracy when applied to precipitation data, outperforming
conventional empirical models. Notably, our research reveals that the
parameters within these equations are dynamic, adapting to evolving climate
patterns. Ultimately, the unveiled equations have practical applications,
particularly in fine-scale downscaling for precipitation predictions using
low-resolution future climate data. This capability offers invaluable insights
into the anticipated changes in precipitation patterns across diverse terrains
under future climate scenarios, which enhances our ability to address the
challenges posed by contemporary climate science.

tools, as well as challenges and difficulties in behavior tree evolution.

*Sarah L. Thomson, L\'eni K. Le Goff, Emma Hart, Edgar Buchanan* 

  Morpho-evolution (ME) refers to the simultaneous optimisation of a robot's
design and controller to maximise performance given a task and environment.
Many genetic encodings have been proposed which are capable of representing
design and control. Previous research has provided empirical comparisons
between encodings in terms of their performance with respect to an objective
function and the diversity of designs that are evaluated, however there has
been no attempt to explain the observed findings. We address this by applying
Local Optima Network (LON) analysis to investigate the structure of the fitness
landscapes induced by three different encodings when evolving a robot for a
locomotion task, shedding new light on the ease by which different fitness
landscapes can be traversed by a search process. This is the first time LON
analysis has been applied in the field of ME despite its popularity in
combinatorial optimisation domains; the findings will facilitate design of new
algorithms or operators that are customised to ME landscapes in the future.

*Edward Pantridge, Thomas Helmuth* 

  Contemporary genetic programming (GP) systems for general program synthesis
have been primarily concerned with evolving programs that can manipulate values
from a standard set of primitive data types and simple indexed data structures.
In contrast, human programmers do not limit themselves to a small finite set of
data types and use polymorphism to express an unbounded number of types
including nested data structures, product types, and generic functions.
Code-building Genetic Programming (CBGP) is a recently introduced method that
compiles type-safe programs from linear genomes using stack-based compilation
and a formal type system. Although prior work with CBGP has shown initial
demonstrations of polymorphism inside evolved programs, we have provided a
deeper exploration of these capabilities through the evolution of programs
which make use of generic data types such as key-value maps, tuples, and sets,
as well as higher order functions and functions with polymorphic type
signatures. In our experiments, CBGP is able to solve problems with all of
these properties, where every other GP system that we know of has restrictions
that make it unable to even consider problems with these properties. This
demonstration provides a significant step towards fully aligning the
expressiveness of GP to real world programming.

*William B. Langdon and Justyna Petke and Aymeric Blot and David Clark* 

  By their very name caches are often overlooked and yet play a vital role in
the performance of modern and indeed future hardware. Using MAGPIE (Machine
Automated General Performance Improvement via Evolution of software) we show
genetic improvement GI can reduce the cache load of existing computer programs.
Operating on lines of C and C++ source code using local search, Magpie can
generate new functionally equivalent variants which generate fewer L1 data
cache misses. Cache miss reduction is tested on two industrial open source
programs (Google's Open Location Code OLC and Uber's Hexagonal Hierarchical
Spatial Index H3) and two 2D photograph image processing tasks, counting pixels
and OpenCV's SEEDS segmentation algorithm.
  Magpie's patches functionally generalise. In one case they reduce data misses
on the highest performance L1 cache dramatically by 47 percent.

### 12 Aug 2012 | [An Efficient Genetic Programming System with Geometric Semantic  Operators and its Application to Human Oral Bioavailability Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/1208.2437) | [‚¨áÔ∏è](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1208.2437)
*Mauro Castelli, Luca Manzoni, Leonardo Vanneschi* 

  Very recently new genetic operators, called geometric semantic operators,
have been defined for genetic programming. Contrarily to standard genetic
operators, which are uniquely based on the syntax of the individuals, these new
operators are based on their semantics, meaning with it the set of input-output
pairs on training data. Furthermore, these operators present the interesting
property of inducing a unimodal fitness landscape for every problem that
consists in finding a match between given input and output data (for instance
regression and classification). Nevertheless, the current definition of these
operators has a serious limitation: they impose an exponential growth in the
size of the individuals in the population, so their use is impossible in
practice. This paper is intended to overcome this limitation, presenting a new
genetic programming system that implements geometric semantic operators in an
extremely efficient way. To demonstrate the power of the proposed system, we
use it to solve a complex real-life application in the field of
pharmacokinetic: the prediction of the human oral bioavailability of potential
new drugs. Besides the excellent performances on training data, which were
expected because the fitness landscape is unimodal, we also report an excellent
generalization ability of the proposed system, at least for the studied
application. In fact, it outperforms standard genetic programming and a wide
set of other well-known machine learning methods.

*Dominik Sobania, Martin Briesch, Philipp R\"ochner, Franz Rothlauf* 

  Genetic programming is an evolutionary approach known for its performance in
program synthesis. However, it is not yet mature enough for a practical use in
real-world software development, since usually many training cases are required
to generate programs that generalize to unseen test cases. As in practice, the
training cases have to be expensively hand-labeled by the user, we need an
approach to check the program behavior with a lower number of training cases.
Metamorphic testing needs no labeled input/output examples. Instead, the
program is executed multiple times, first on a given (randomly generated)
input, followed by related inputs to check whether certain user-defined
relations between the observed outputs hold. In this work, we suggest MTGP,
which combines metamorphic testing and genetic programming and study its
performance and the generalizability of the generated programs. Further, we
analyze how the generalizability depends on the number of given labeled
training cases. We find that using metamorphic testing combined with labeled
training cases leads to a higher generalization rate than the use of labeled
training cases alone in almost all studied configurations. Consequently, we
recommend researchers to use metamorphic testing in their systems if the
labeling of the training data is expensive.

*Matthew Andres Moreno, Santiago Rodriguez Papa, Alexander Lalejini,  Charles Ofria* 

  Event-driven genetic programming representations have been shown to
outperform traditional imperative representations on interaction-intensive
problems. The event-driven approach organizes genome content into modules that
are triggered in response to environmental signals, simplifying simulation
design and implementation. Existing work developing event-driven genetic
programming methodology has largely used the SignalGP library, which caters to
traditional program synthesis applications. The SignalGP-Lite library enables
larger-scale artificial life experiments with streamlined agents by reducing
control flow overhead and trading run-time flexibility for better performance
due to compile-time configuration. Here, we report benchmarking experiments
that show an 8x to 30x speedup. We also report solution quality equivalent to
SignalGP on two benchmark problems originally developed to test the ability of
evolved programs to respond to a large number of signals and to modulate signal
response based on context.
